From a discussion between myself and <a href=\"http://mikelittle.org/\">Mike Little</a> about <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">forking our favorite blogging software</a>, to powering 18% of the web. It&#8217;s been a crazy, exciting, journey, and one that won&#8217;t stop any time soon.</p>\n<p>At ten years, it&#8217;s fun to reflect on our beginnings. We launched WordPress on 27th May 2003, but that wasn&#8217;t inception. Go back far enough, and you can <a href=\"http://zengun.org/weblog/archives/2001/06/post1958/\">read a post by Michel Valdrighi</a> who, frustrated by the self-hosted blogging platforms available, decided to write his own software; &#8220;b2, a PHP+MySQL alternative to Blogger and GreyMatter.&#8221; b2 was easy to install, easy to configure, and easy for developers to extend. Of all the blogging platforms out there, <a href=\"http://cafelog.com\">b2</a> was the right one for me: I could write my content and get it on the web quickly and painlessly.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, however, life gets in the way. In 2002, Michel stopped maintaining b2. Over time, security flaws became apparent and updates were needed and, while the b2 community could write patches and fixes, no one was driving the software forward. We were lucky that Michel decided to release b2 under the GPL; the software may have been abandoned, but we weren&#8217;t without options. A fork was always a possibility. That was where it stood in January 2003, when <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/\">I posted about forking b2</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/#comment-445\">Mike responded</a>. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n<p>From the very beginning to the present day, I&#8217;ve been impressed by the thought, care, and dedication that WordPress&#8217; developers have demonstrated. Each one has brought his or her unique perspective, each individual has strengthened the whole. It would be impossible to thank each of them here individually, but their achievements speak for themselves. In WordPress 1.2 the new Plugin API made it easy for developers to extend WordPress. In the same release <code>gettext()</code> internationalization opened WordPress up to every language (hat tip: <a href=\"http://ryan.boren.me/\">Ryan Boren</a> for spending hours wrapping strings with gettext). In WordPress 1.5 our Theme system made it possible for WordPress users to quickly change their site&#8217;s design: there was huge resistance to the theme system from the wider community at the time, but can you imagine WordPress without it? Versions 2.7, 2.8, and 2.9 saw improvements that let users install and update their plugins and themes with one click. WordPress has seen a redesign by <a href=\"http://v2.happycog.com/create/wordpress/?p=design/wordpress/\">happycog</a> (2.3) and gone under extensive user testing and redesign (<a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/edanzico/riding-the-crazyhorse-future-generation-wordpress-presentation\">Crazyhorse</a>, Liz Danzico and Jen Mylo, WordPress 2.5). In WordPress 3.0 we merged WordPress MU with WordPress &#8212; a huge job but 100% worth it. And in WordPress 3.5 we revamped the media uploader to make it easier for people to get their images, video, and media online.</p>\n<p>In sticking to our commitment to user experience, we&#8217;ve done a few things that have made us unpopular. The <a href=\"http://tech.gaeatimes.com/index.php/archive/wordpress-wysiwyg-editor-is-a-disaster/\">WYSIWYG editor</a> was hated by many, especially those who felt that if you have a blog you should know HTML. Some developers hated that we stuck with our code, refusing to rewrite, but it&#8217;s always been the users that matter: better a developer lose sleep than a site break for a user. Our code isn&#8217;t always beautiful, after all, when WordPress was created most of us were still learning PHP, but we try to make a flawless experience for users.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not all about developers. WordPress&#8217; strength lies in the diversity of its community. From the start, we wanted a low barrier to entry and we came up with our &#8220;famous 5 minute install&#8221;. This brought on board users from varied technical background: people who didn&#8217;t write code wanted to help make WordPress better. If you couldn&#8217;t write code, it didn&#8217;t matter: you could answer a question in the support forums, write documentation, translate WordPress, or build your friends and family a WordPress website. There is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">space in the community</a> for anyone with a passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s been wonderful to see all of the people who have used WordPress to build their home on the internet. Early on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/switchers/\">we got excited</a> by <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2004/04/more-switchers/\">switchers</a>. From a community of tinkerers we grew, as writers such as <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/05/om-malik/\">Om Malik</a>, <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2004/05/15/mark-pilgrim-switches/\">Mark Pilgrim</a>, and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2004/07/mollycom-switches/\">Molly Holzschlag</a> made the switch to WordPress. Our commitment to effortless publishing quickly paid off and has continued to do so: <strong>the WordPress 1.2 release saw 822 downloads per day, our latest release, WordPress 3.5, has seen 145,692 per day.</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m continually amazed by what people have built with WordPress. I&#8217;ve seen <a href=\"http://justintimberlake.com/main/\">musicians</a> and <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/01/neil-leifer-on-wordpress/\">photographers</a>, magazines such as <a href=\"http://life.time.com/\">Life</a>, <a href=\"http://boingboing.net/\">BoingBoing</a>, and the <a href=\"http://observer.com/\">New York Observer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.compliance.gov/\">government websites</a>, a <a href=\"http://josephscott.org/archives/2011/05/pressfs-a-wordpress-filesystem/\">filesystem</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ymcanyc.org/association/pages/y-mvp\"> mobile applications</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.viper007bond.com/2010/06/12/so-apparently-wordpress-can-guide-missiles/\">seen WordPress guide missiles</a>.</p>\n<p>As the web evolves, WordPress evolves. Factors outside of our control will always influence WordPress&#8217; development: today it&#8217;s mobile devices and retina display, tomorrow it could be Google Glass or technology not yet conceived. A lot can happen in ten years! As technology changes and advances, WordPress has to change with it while remaining true to its core values: making publishing online easy for everyone. How we rise to these challenges will be what defines WordPress over the coming ten years.</p>\n<p><strong>To celebrate ten years of WordPress, we&#8217;re working on a book about our history.</strong> We&#8217;re carrying out interviews with people who have involved with the community from the very beginning, those who are still around, and those who have left. It&#8217;s a huge project, but we wanted to have something to share with you on the 10th anniversary. To learn about the very early days of WordPress, just after Mike and I forked b2 <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/history/\">you can download Chapter 3 right here</a>. We&#8217;ll be releasing the rest of the book serially, so watch out as the story of the last ten years emerges.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\"> I penned my own letter to WordPress</a> and other community members have been sharing their thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://zed1.com/journalized/archives/2013/01/25/wordpress-a-10-year-journey/\">Mike Little on our Ten Year Journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Core contributor Helen Hou-Sandi <a href=\"http://helen.wordpress.com/2013/05/27/happy-10th-wordpress-and-thanks-from-my-little-family/\">wishes WordPress happy birthday</a>.</li>\n<li>Peter Westwood on <a href=\"http://blog.ftwr.co.uk/archives/2013/05/27/a-decade-gone-more-to-come/\">a decade gone</a>.</li>\n<li>Support rep Mika Epstein <a href=\"http://ipstenu.org/2013/you-me-and-wp/\">on her WordPress journey</a>.</li>\n<li>Dougal Campbell <a href=\"http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2013/05/27/instagram-my-wife-suzecampbell-and-i-celebrating-the-wordpress-10th-anniversary-with-bbq-in-our-wordpress-shirts-wp10/\">celebrating with his wife, Suze</a>.</li>\n<li>Otto on <a href=\"http://ottodestruct.com/blog/2013/how-wp-affected-me/\">how WordPress affected him</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can see how WordPress&#8217; 10th Anniversary was celebrated all over the world <a href=\"http://wp10.wordpress.net/\">by visiting the wp10 website</a>, according to Meetup we had 4,999 celebrators.</p>\n<p>To finish, I just want to say thank you to everyone: to the developers who write the code, to the designers who make WordPress sing, to the worldwide community translating WordPress into so many languages, to volunteers who answer support questions, to those who make WordPress accessible, to the systems team and the plugin and theme reviewers, to documentation writers, event organisers, evangelists, detractors, supporters and friends. Thanks to the jazzers whose music inspired us and whose names are at the heart of WordPress.

With hundreds of parties going on today, it&#8217;s more visible than ever just how popular WordPress has become.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to everyone who has ever contributed to this project: your labors of love made this day possible.</strong></p>\n<p>But today isn&#8217;t just about reflecting on how we got this far (though I thought <a href=\"http://ma.tt/2013/05/dear-wordpress/\">Matt&#8217;s reflection on the first ten years</a> was lovely). We are constantly moving forward. As each release cycle begins and ends (3.6 will be here soon, promise!), we always see an ebb and flow in the contributor pool. Part of ensuring the longevity of WordPress means mentoring new contributors, continually bringing new talent and fresh points of view to our family table.</p>\n<p>I am beyond pleased to announce that this summer we will be mentoring 8 interns, most of them new contributors, through <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code</a> and the <a href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/2013/JuneSeptember\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women</a>. Current contributors, who already volunteer their time working on WordPress, will provide the guidance and oversight for a variety of exciting projects  this summer. Here are the people/projects involved in the summer internships:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><strong>Ryan McCue</strong>, </strong>from Australia, working on a JSON-based REST API. Mentors will be Bryan Petty and Eric Mann, with a reviewer assist from Andrew Norcross.</li>\n<li><strong>Kat Hagan</strong>, from the United States, working on a Post by Email plugin to replace the core function. Mentors will be Justin Shreve and George Stephanis, with an assist from Peter Westwood.</li>\n<li><strong>Siobhan Bamber</strong>, from Wales, working on a support (forums, training, documentation) internship. Mentors will be Mika Epstein and Hanni Ross.</li>\n<li><strong>Frederick Ding</strong>, from the United States, working on improving portability. Mentors will be Andrew Nacin and Mike Schroder.</li>\n<li><strong>Sayak Sakar</strong>, from India, working on porting WordPress for WebOS to Firefox OS. Mentor will be Eric Johnson.</li>\n<li><strong>Alex Höreth</strong>, from Germany, working on  adding WordPress native revisions to the theme and plugin code editors. Mentors will be Dominik Schilling and Aaron Campbell, with a reviewer assist from Daniel Bachhuber.</li>\n<li><strong>Mert Yazicioglu</strong>, from Turkey, working on ways to improve our community profiles at profiles.wordpress.org. Mentors will be Scott Reilly and Boone Gorges.</li>\n<li><strong>Daniele Maio</strong>, from Italy, working on a native WordPress app for Blackberry 10. Mentor will be Danilo Ercoli.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Did you notice that our summer cohort is as international as the #wp10 parties going on today? I can only think that this is a good sign.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s always a difficult process to decide which projects to mentor through these programs. There are always more applicants with interesting ideas with whom we&#8217;d like to work than there are opportunities. Luckily, WordPress is a free/libre open source software project, and anyone can begin contributing at any time. Is this the year for you? We&#8217;d love for you to join us as we work toward #wp20. <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif\' alt=\';)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' /> </p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/the-next-10-starts-now/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:20:\"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 11 May 2013 03:44:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:374:\"WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general. (Pick us, pick us! <img src=\'http://wordpress.org/news/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\' alt=\':)\' class=\'wp-smiley\' />  )</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The summer installment of the Gnome Outreach Program for Women follows the same schedule and general application format as GSoC, though there are more potential projects since it covers more areas of contribution. Women college students interested in doing a coding project are encouraged to apply for both programs to increase the odds of acceptance. All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Outreach Program for Women page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p>The application period just started, and it lasts another week (May 1 for Gnome, May 3 for GSoC), so if you think you qualify and are interested in getting involved, check out the information pages, get in touch, and apply… Good luck!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">Google Summer of Code 2013 Information</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Gnome_Summer_Program_for_Women\">Gnome Summer Outreach Program for Women 2013 Information</a></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/summer-mentorship-programs-gsoc-and-gnome/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"WordPress 10th Anniversary Tees\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Apr 2013 16:40:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Events\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"Store\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"swag\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"wp10\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2561\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:338:\"In honor of the upcoming 10th anniversary celebrations, we&#8217;ve put a special 10th anniversary tshirt in the swag store at cost &#8212; $10 per shirt plus shipping.

Today we&#8217;re pleased to see that the WordPress Plugin Repository has just hit 26,000 plugins in the index. This is quite an accomplishment! I&#8217;m grateful to all the developers out there who put in thankless days and sleepless nights creating these magnificent plugins. They can&#8217;t all be a perfect 10 plugin, but the simple fact that people are making a solid effort to participate in the community is very commendable.</p>\n<p>Before we begin, make sure that you test out all these plugins on a staging site. It&#8217;s always best to create a mirror of a live site with an identical set of plugins. Then install the new plugin to see how it interacts with the others. After a day or so, you&#8217;ll get to know the functionality, speed and performance of the site with the new plugin installed. If everything seems to be cool, then it&#8217;s probably safe to remove the plugin from your &#8220;quarantine&#8221; and use it on an actual live site.</p>\n<p><a title=\"YouTube Comments\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-comments/\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube Comments</a> is yet another tentacle in the power of the commenting system. This little gem allows you to automatically pull in the comments from a YouTube linked video from within the post. I like this because it keeps my WordPress installation as the central hub for everything despite how many social services that I want to hook it to on the outside. The plugin allows comments by all users logged into YouTube. Hopefully this doesn&#8217;t become abused or has some degree of control of spam.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Blog Watch WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/blog-watch/\" target=\"_blank\">Blog Watch</a> helps you monitor the competition or fellow content creators right in your dashboard. It runs on both RSS and ATOM feeds. You simply add the feed URL and the posts will be inserted in the dashboard module. An added bonus is that if you do not know a specific feed URL, the plugin will attempt to locate it for you based on the main URL of the blog you want to monitor. This could be used to monitor the blogging activity streams of your favorite authors, sites with similar interests or anything you choose. Heck, why not double up and add the <a title=\"WP Tavern Feed\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/feed/\" target=\"_blank\">WPTavern feed</a> to it as well, ok?</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-8086\" alt=\"Time Difference\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/time-difference.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a><a title=\"Time Difference\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/time-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Time Difference</a> calculates the amount of time between the current date of your WordPress installation and a date that you signify in shortcode form. The date can be either in the past or in the future. I like the versatility of this plugin, as it can act as a countdown timer to an event and as a running stopwatch of something that has started. It could be used in a number of practical ways. Days left in Summer, countdown to when school starts, days since you were born and on and on. Since it&#8217;s shortcode based, you&#8217;ll be able to use this within content as well as within a widget.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Free Voice Comment System\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/uemotioncom-free-voice-comment-system/\" target=\"_blank\">Free Voice Comment System</a> is another plugin I tried in hopes of finding a free solution for Speakpipe. This plugin ideally would have the same functionality in that a site viewer would be able to record an audio comment with just one click-through their browser. In the case of this plugin, it runs off a service called uemotion.com, a social messaging site based on audio recordings. I could not get the plugin to function at all after installation, from requesting an API key on down. This one is simple not ready for prime time, as the site crashes every time you try to request a key. I tried it on 3 different staging sites with the same result. Oh well. I&#8217;ll keep on searching.</p>\n<p>Last Friday I mentioned that there would be some news for those fans of the column that are commuters seeking an audio version of The Daily Plugin. After some consideration and discussion with Jeff, I&#8217;ve decided to give the people what they want and create a daily audio recording. We will wait until the next version of WordPress officially drops so that we can take advantage of using the new audio and video capabilities within the Media center. I can&#8217;t wait!</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/BAscCKypc38\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:23:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Marcus Couch\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Release Candidate 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2649\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/07/wordpress-3-6-release-candidate-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1324:\"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 3.6 is now available for download and testing.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re down to only a few remaining issues, and the final release should be available in a matter of days.

For starters, these two get bonus points for adding a settings link that is accessible from the Plugin management page. I wish more plugins would do that. Just drag the icons representing the social networks you want to use to the Enabled Social Services box. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8077\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarSetup.jpg?resize=500%2C368\" alt=\"Floating Social Bar Setup\" class=\"size-large wp-image-8077\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Configuring This Plugin Is Easy!</p></div>\n<p>You can alter the text that displays to the left of the icons, determine where those buttons show up, add your Twitter username and configure the interval to update stats which are displayed to the right of each icon. I believe this varies between themes but depending upon how long the text is before the social icons, it will force some of them to the next line, which is not pretty. </p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8078\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/FloatingSocialBarIcons.jpg?resize=495%2C96\" alt=\"Floating Social Bar Icons\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8078\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">As seen in the Twenty Eleven Theme</p></div>\n<p>My personal preference is to have sharing icons located below the post content, near some of the meta data as seen on WPTavern articles. This plugin doesn&#8217;t allow that, at least not from its settings page. This is one of the reasons why Publicize by Jetpack will be a better option. Publicize gives users options to control the look of the icons and where they are located. With Floating Social Bar, the icons are stuck at the top of the post.</p>\n<p>This plugin provides a quick and easy way to display sharing icons without all of the additional functionality that comes with Publicize in JetPack. If that&#8217;s what you need, this plugin is excellent. If you&#8217;re looking for more flexibility, especially for how these icons are displayed, I suggest using Publicize in Jetpack. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/q7E9HaMqxAY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 23 Jul 2013 00:18:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Creating A Digital Publication In WordPress With The IssueM Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8068\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/nR1Xamk6kl4/creating-a-digital-publication-in-wordpress-with-the-issuem-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2006:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IssueMLogo.jpg?resize=74%2C81\" alt=\"Issue M Logo\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-8074\" /></a>Built by LewAyotte, Peter Ericson, and Glenn Ansley the recently released open-source plugin known as <a href=\"https://issuem.com\" title=\"https://issuem.com\">IssueM</a> provides publishers the opportunity to harness the ease of WordPress to turn their site into an Issue based publication. After taking a look at <a href=\"http://issuem.com/showcase/\" title=\"http://issuem.com/showcase/\">their showcase</a>, I decided to try out the plugin for myself. </p>\n<p>I installed the plugin on my demo test site and had a hard time maneuvering around and getting things setup the way they were supposed to. Out of the box, it&#8217;s difficult to know how things are supposed to be setup. I hope in the future, these guys take full advantage of <strong><a href=\"http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers\" title=\"http://www.paulund.co.uk/introduce-wordpress-pointers\">Pointers</a></strong> that were added to the core of WordPress 3.3.

WPVote was described by many as a Digg like site but for WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong>First off Ben, tell us a little bit about who you are and what you&#8217;ve been up to these days.</strong></p>\n<p>Hi Jeff. I have been working online since the early 2000&#8242;s, and started with WordPress around 2004. I released a free theme that was one of the first added to <a href=\"http://wordpress.com/\" title=\"http://wordpress.com/\">wordpress.com</a> &#8211; and after I started <a href=\"http://prothemedesign.com/\" title=\"http://prothemedesign.com/\">prothemedesign.com</a> which I still run today. Currently I am still building themes, with the best being premium themes on wordpress.com.</p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s been 3 years since the launch of WPVote. In that period of time, are you happy with the results of your experiment?</strong></p>\n<p>WPVote has been a fantastic learning experience for me. Honestly &#8211; it never took off as I would have liked &#8211; but I was able to achieve everything I set out to do. In addition, and what many people probably don&#8217;t think of &#8211; is that when building WPVote I created a product that I sold on <a href=\"http://prothemedesign.com/\" title=\"http://prothemedesign.com/\">prothemedesign.com</a> &#8211; and it has done quite nicely for me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/wpvotelogo.png?resize=238%2C50\" alt=\"WPVote Logo\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3101\" /></a></p>\n<p>That said &#8211; since you first asked me about doing this interview WPVote has been under a sustained flood of traffic, which has made the site un-responsive. There are patterns to the traffic, but the blocks I have put in place haven&#8217;t helped and the rest of the site doesn&#8217;t respond. Without improving my hosting (which isn&#8217;t financially viable) I think the future of wpvote is in doubt at the moment :(</p>\n<p><strong>Can you share some statistics regarding the site such as submissions, new user registrations, etc?</strong></p>\n<p>Well &#8211; <a href=\"http://wpvote.com/\" title=\"http://wpvote.com/\">wpvote.com</a> currently has <strong>10,022 users</strong> and <strong>1,962 public posts</strong>. I haven&#8217;t measured how many but wpvote automatically deletes old posts that point to websites/web pages that no longer exist. As such, there&#8217;s probably a couple hundred posts that have been removed. There&#8217;s currently about 20 users who are consistently posting new content to the site, with 5 to 10 new posts a week being published. The (legitimate) traffic to the site isn&#8217;t huge but it has a good pagerank so it can be a nice bonus for your site.</p>\n<p><strong>From the outside looking in, I haven&#8217;t seen WPVote become a destination hotspot to see what&#8217;s happening in the world of WordPress. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\n<p>My biggest problem, with everything I do (I&#8217;m well aware that this is a weakness), is marketing. I don&#8217;t have the network &#8211; or the skills/ knowledge &#8211; that others in the community have. Poststat.us has shown that this type of website in the WordPress niche can work &#8211; and I&#8217;m really pleased Brian managed to do it. In addition Poststat.us has managed to keep the content higher quality &#8211; presumably through a more manual review process which is bound to have helped.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPVoteFrontPage.jpg?resize=398%2C265\" alt=\"WPVote Front Page\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8063\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Are there any specific lessons you&#8217;ve learned by operating WPVote in the past three years?</strong></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot about programming and developing complex themes. I probably shouldn&#8217;t say this about a product I still sell, but I&#8217;d quite like to rewrite Nominate. I&#8217;ve also learned a lot about WordPress itself &#8211; using functionality you wouldn&#8217;t normally use in a theme. Things like submitting posts &#8211; and integrating spam management tools, more complex admin tools, and using wp-cron to automatically check on validity of old content. It&#8217;s been a really good way to grow as a developer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/NominateTheme.jpg?resize=516%2C305\" alt=\"Nominate Theme\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-8064\" /></a></p>\n<p>In my article <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote\" title=\"http://www.wptavern.com/ben-gillbanks-launches-wpvote\">where I described the launch of WPVote</a>, I mentioned near the end that it would be cool to see something like WPVote replace the WordPress planet feed so the community played a larger role in determining what was shown on the front page. Have you had any inquiries regarding this? Is it something you would like to pursue?</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had a few inquiries to buy/invest in the site but I&#8217;ve turned everyone down so far. I&#8217;m not really in this for the money &#8211; I wanted to do it because I think WordPress is awesome and I wanted to try to help promote the community.</p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t had any inquiries regarding syndicating the content for something more <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\" title=\"http://wordpress.org/\">wordpress.org</a> related but doing something like that would be awesome &#8211; I&#8217;m certainly open to considering things like this (if I can ever get the site live again).</p>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;d like to know your thoughts regarding PostStat.us and their recent redesign. It looks like the site is gaining traction and is starting to gain more user based submissions.</strong></p>\n<p>I think the PostStat.us redesign is fantastic. IMO It&#8217;s not very visual &#8211; and the design is quite dry. It plays down the social/ community aspect &#8211; but the content is great and it&#8217;s building itself up nicely. Since PostStat.us is mostly about the community and writing opinion pieces based upon submitted content/ news &#8211; I think it would be nice to showcase the other sites more, possibly through website screenshots (like on wpvote) or perhaps some other means.</p>\n<p>The thing I am missing with WPVote is the community actively submitting and (more importantly) voting on the content. If people don&#8217;t interact then there&#8217;s no point running the site.

According to the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/about/domains/\" title=\"http://wordpress.org/about/domains/\">domain policy</a>, this is a violation of the WordPress trademark unless they have explicit permission. A couple days ago, I came across one such site which was brand new and the press release talked about their recent launch. I sent the owner of the site a message letting them know that they were violating the trademark and that they should think about a WP variant. While some responses are vulgar, the one from this person showed that they had made a mistake as they had no idea about the policy. Below is a short conversation over email. I&#8217;ve removed the person&#8217;s name as well as their website as it&#8217;s not needed to illustrate the point.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; I read a press release today about the launch of (Name Of Service) and I just wanted to let you know that by using the full term of WordPress in the domain name, you are violating the WordPress trademark. http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/ I suggest switching your domain name to WP****** if possible or try obtaining permission to use the trademark in your domain name.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; Oh damn it, thanks for letting me know! I had no idea. I&#8217;ll see what I can do about changing the name. Kind regards,</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; You&#8217;re welcome. Tons of people make the same mistake. Sorry you have to go about changing the domain.</p>\n<p><strong>Response</strong> &#8211; I looked into it yesterday and yeah, I really (bad word) up here. I bought the domain wp***** and migrated the whole site there, I&#8217;ll be 301 redirecting the whole site today. I&#8217;m sorry if I caused any bad feelings about my venture, just trying to make a living helping others with the CMS I love. I&#8217;ll be changing my email too in the next couple of days. Thanks for reaching out and letting me know so I could change the domain. I really appreciate it.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeff</strong> &#8211; Nope, no bad feelings caused. I usually send out a friendly email to anyone violating the trademark as it&#8217;s best to deal with it early versus having that domain be established. You should be all set to go now. Good luck with your service. Oh, as a sidenote. I would look for any where you wrote Word(lowercase p)ress on the site and change it to WordPress as that&#8217;s the correct way to write it. It&#8217;s one of those weird prickly points the community has.</p>\n<p><strong>Response </strong>- Hi, Yeah, I found the discussion on Twitter, it seemed to cause a big stir among some. Saw some guy called me a douche for missing the capital P so I&#8217;ve changed it already. Thanks</p>\n<p>A couple of reasons why I published our email exchange. The first is to show that sometimes, people have good intentions but make an honest mistake. They didn&#8217;t know about the domain policy and rushed to change things to make it right. The established people in the WordPress community know about these guidelines and instead of chastising those site owners, we should first reach out to them via email or some other method to at least give them an opportunity to make things right. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250\" title=\"https://twitter.com/jeffr0/status/357576328234549250\">I started the Twitter dialogue</a> by mentioning how disappointed I was to see brand new WordPress services launch that violated the WordPress trademark. On Twitter, it&#8217;s too easy to fire off text that would be better off never being published. I&#8217;ve said a few things in the past I regret as have others. Let&#8217;s try to give everyone the benefit of the doubt before performing regretful actions. </p>\n<p>If you see anyone violating the WordPress trademark via by domain or other means, please try reaching that person via email or getting in touch with them any way possible to let them know. It could just be an honest mistake.</p>\n<p>I almost feel like these two articles need to be appended to every post ever written about WordPress.

We&#8217;ve made it through another week of widgets, fields, posts and plugins. It&#8217;s time to unwind with another installment of The Daily Plugin. We&#8217;ve got some really shiny new plugins to look at today in addition to some recent updates. The plugins listed represent a mere sampling of the most recently updated and newly released plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. Keep in mind that these plugins, like any plugin, should be tested on a staging site first to make sure that it works with your particular project parameters. Some plugins don&#8217;t work well with certain themes or other plugins. It&#8217;s always smart to test first to make sure all the plugins are working well together and performing as you expect them all to in harmony. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Suggest Review WordPress Plugin\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/suggest-review/assets/screenshot-2.png?resize=218%2C24\" /></a><a title=\"Suggest Review WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/suggest-review/\" target=\"_blank\">Suggest Review</a> encourages users of the site to raise awareness of suspect or inaccurate content that may already be published to the site. It provides the viewer the opportunity to &#8220;flag&#8221; content and write a note to the administrator explaining the nature of their alert. I like the nature of the &#8220;suggestion&#8221; as it is done as a privately submitted form rather than out in public full view. The simple fact that this is a constructive mechanism for content revision, as opposed to the &#8220;comment trolls&#8221; is a welcome relief. There are safeguards in place that can restrict who sees or can submit to the &#8220;suggest review&#8221; button and functions. You can limit it to registered users so that the public or spammers are not pounding the system with false posts.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Microblog Poster WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/microblog-poster/\" target=\"_blank\">Microblog Poster</a> promises the ability to cross-post your newest content to multiple social sites such as Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin, Plurk, Diigo and Delicious. While I am still testing this on my staging sites, I can report that so far I&#8217;ve run into nothing but success. There are very few plugins out there that integrate with LinkedIn properly. Microblog Poster handled all my posts with relative ease. While I use other plugins to handle my Twitter and Facebook notifications, this one will make a favorable addition to many of the WordPress sites that I frequently update content in. I anticipate that the developer will add more social sites as they become available as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Insert Estimated Reading Time\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/screenshot-1.png?resize=119%2C90\" /></a><a title=\"Insert Estimated Reading Time WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-estimated-reading-time/\" target=\"_blank\">Insert Estimated Reading Time</a> helps to list an approximate reading time to your posts. The time calculation is based on a variable that you enter in the plugin&#8217;s settings screen. You have the option of displaying minutes or minutes/seconds in the display, as well as the template used, i.e. &#8220;This article will around XX minutes to read. Make sure you have a full beer before beginning.&#8221;. Quite a handy gadget to have at the start of your posts, especially if you tend to post a lot of lengthy content.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Comment CaVa WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/commentcava/\" target=\"_blank\">CommentCaVa</a> sets a virtual timer on your posts before a reader is allowed to make a comment. The concept is unique in that it forces the viewer to actually read the content first before they can comment. I&#8217;m not sure of the anti-spam implications of this plugin, but it may stop the flow on that end as well. It works within the native WordPress commenting system by installing a small JavaScript containing the timer elements. This is a new plugin with a developer that&#8217;s hungry to grow the functionality of the plugin, so please join <a title=\"Wordpress Profile for WortWart\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/wortwart/\" target=\"_blank\">WortWart</a> in making this plugin something that we can all use to extend on-page time of our readership.</p>\n<p>Well another week of The Daily Plugin is in the books. This weekend I&#8217;ll be taking it easy and hitting some outdoor events with my lovely wife. I&#8217;ll be back on Monday with a bit of a surprise for all of you Daily Plugin fans out there that have a commute. You can follow me on Twitter <a title=\"Marcus Couch on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/marcuscouch\">@marcuscouch</a> or leave your feedback right here on <a title=\"The Daily Plugin for 7-19-2013\" href=\"http://wptavern.com/the-daily-plugin-for-07-19-2013\">WPTavern.com</a>.

I know what you&#8217;re thinking. It&#8217;s already Thursday and The Daily Plugin has yet to find that perfect plugin that you&#8217;ve been &#8220;<em>Repository Diving</em>&#8221; for all week-long. Well today is your lucky day my friend. Not because we may have found that hidden gem you&#8217;ve been on the hunt for, but because we saved you at least one day of having to look for it yourself. It&#8217;s a dirty job, but someone has to do it. Remember to prevent your own sites from becoming a cesspool of non-functioning calamity, always test these plugins on a staging site. You never know what kind of damage new plugins can do to a site without proper evaluation and investigation. Even the smallest function of a plugin can turn a site and its theme completely upside-down. Also, let&#8217;s remember that the plugins that follow are merely a sampling of the newest and most recently updated plugins found in the WordPress Plugin Repository. They are not endorsed in any official capacity. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mozscape/assets/screenshot-1.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"MOZ Analytics\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/mozscape/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=175%2C93\" /></a><a title=\"MozScape Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/mozscape/\" target=\"_blank\">Mozscape</a> is a recent release from the folks over at Moz (Formerly known as SEOMoz) that allows you to view analytical data from MozScape about the post you are currently editing. Data included in the analysis includes Moz Rank, MozTrust, page authority ranking, Total links (both internal and external) and anchor text metrics. This provides a great opportunity to analyze and re-optimize existing content on your site that you depend on for a constant flow of traffic. I&#8217;ve had great experiences using Moz in the past for analysis of client sites. It will be great to incorporate some of the same functionality directly into the WordPress content editor. Give it a shot if you have the least bit of curiosity as to how your writing style coördinates with what should be optimized in your content. You may be surprised to learn that with just a few minor edits and tweaks, you can get a page to rank quickly and keep it there. This is a free usage plugin, but it will require registration to Moz for an API key.</p>\n<p><a title=\"WP Welcome Message\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-welcome-message/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Welcome Message</a> displays an intro &#8220;<em>pop-up</em>&#8221; box for new visitors to your site. The content of the pop-up is created using a standard WordPress rich editor, allowing you to add any kind of content, HTML or short codes to your pop-up. The CSS elements conformed to my site with little challenge. This is a simple, easy way to add a brief introduction to yourself, talk about a special event or promotion, or any other need you see fit.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Automatic Post Date Filler WordPress Plugin\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/automatic-post-date-filler/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=184%2C100\" /></a><a title=\"Automatic Post Date Filler\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/automatic-post-date-filler/\" target=\"_blank\">Automatic Post Date Filler</a> has a lot of intriguing uses, especially for someone like me who adds scheduled content to over 70 different WordPress installs on a monthly basis. The plugin works by setting a custom date and time for scheduled posts. Sort of like a smart playlist, it uses variables like &#8220;Current Date + X days&#8221; or &#8220;Time from the Furthest Scheduled Post + X Minutes&#8221; to determine how you would like the system to automatically schedule your next post. This is a fantastic &#8220;on deck&#8221; model to handle scheduled posts, making sure that all posts are as evenly spaced out as possible when published. It&#8217;s also great to prevent a mass post dump from happening all at once by automatically applying the scheduling limitation rules. It also provides an alternative button in your post editor, &#8220;Publish Immediately&#8221; which will override the scheduling filters and publish without any time alterations.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Better User Profile Fields\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/better-user-profile-fields/\" target=\"_blank\">Better User Profile Fields</a> is something that incorporates a multitude of Social networking profiles into the standard WordPress user profile including Facebook, Twitter, Google+, Deviant Art and Tumblr. It can also use this data to populate different elements of your theme or content as well, simply by inserting PHP. For example, to add the Twitter profile URL of the user you would use <strong>get_author_meta(&#8216;twitter&#8217;)</strong>. Anyone who is a regular listener to <a title=\"Wordpress Plugins A-Z Podcast\" href=\"http://wppluginsatoz.com\">WordPress Plugins A-Z</a> knows that for years I have been screaming out for better usage of user profiles and the fields that we populate in them. This has all the elements to be a great plugin with a lot of great integration possibilities within themes and widgets. Something that has been lacking in WordPress for quite some time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"WP Hashgrid on Default WordPress theme\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/wp-hashgrid/assets/screenshot-1.png?resize=182%2C106\" /></a><a title=\"WP Hashgrid\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-hashgrid/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Hashgrid</a> is a pure design and developer tool that acts as a grid overlay to your WordPress site. Implementing the hashgrid.js script to overlay a CSS-customizable grid, this plugin helps to keep things centered and in alignment. In the old days I used to print a grid on clear transparency sheets and tape them to the monitor for modifying and finalizing layouts. My, how far we&#8217;ve come! This is a good plugin to do either a full build from the ground up or simply to do an occasional spot check of your designs before launch.</p>\n<p>Well that&#8217;s it for today&#8217;s plugins.

By the way, in Drew&#8217;s <a href=\"http://fotd.werdswords.com/what-is-this/\" title=\"http://fotd.werdswords.com/what-is-this/\">introduction post</a>, he listed 1,003 filter hooks.

Good luck to Drew and I hope that this little experiment enhances the documentation for these filters for generations of WordPress users to come. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/aAy-nlzFVJE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 Jul 2013 19:23:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:49:\"WPTavern: WordPress Gear – Stuff For Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=8001\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/r8Yn6ieb0h8/wordpress-gear-stuff-for-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1237:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPGearLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPGearLogo.jpg?resize=300%2C45\" alt=\"WPGear Logo\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-8002\" /></a>File this website into your resources area. <a href=\"http://wpgear.org/\" title=\"http://wpgear.org/\">WPGear</a> is a compilation of useful developer tools.

security is one of those things in life I find fascinating. It&#8217;s a constant battle between good and evil. Just when the good guys think they have things figured out, the bad guys change their techniques. With all of the good that comes from using Cloud based services, there is also the other side of the coin. Cybersquared, a company dedicated to network and cyber security <a href=\"http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/\" title=\"http://www.cybersquared.com/killing-with-a-borrowed-knife-chaining-core-cloud-service-profile-infrastructure-for-cyber-attacks/\">published a report with their findings</a> on how today&#8217;s attackers are using what they call, <a href=\"https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/\" title=\"https://www.cybersquared.com/hiding-in-the-clouds/\">Service Profile Infrastructure</a> to facilitate command and control a.k.a. C2 phases of attack. </p>\n<p>In this report, it was highlighted that a Chinese Advanced Persistent Threat group used Dropbox and its file sharing notification feature to email links to targets that contained malicious binaries. This was considered phase 1 of the attack. Phase 2 worked with a WordPress.com hosted blog which acted as the command and control center. Once the malicious binaries were in use, the malware contacted the blog which hosted content that contained the IP address as well as the port number to receive commands from. </p>\n<p>Here is a screenshot from the WordPress.com account mentioned in the report. <del datetime=\"2013-07-18T15:49:25+00:00\">The site is still online but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s actively being used in malware attacks. Clearly, the site has been in violation of the <a href=\"http://en.wordpress.com/tos/\" title=\"http://en.wordpress.com/tos/\">WordPress.com TOS</a> for a long time. Specifically this section &#8211; <em>the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</em></del> (It&#8217;s since been suspended)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gressered.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/gressered.jpg?resize=500%2C298\" alt=\"Gressered Website\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7994\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>Once a victim was successfully targeted with the “Yayih” implant, the malware contacted a WordPress blog. It would then read attacker staged content from within the blog posting to obtain a secondary domain, IP address and port number of a second stage C2 host.</p>\n<p>In this example at “gressered.wordpress[.]com”, we found multiple blog posts, all of which had likely served as content for specific targeting campaigns.  The same C2 configuration was “hiding in plain sight”. However, it is entirely possible that the attackers could have modified the second stage C2 configuration at any point previously.

The website has been around for a long time. In fact, in just 10 days, the site will be celebrating its 6th birthday on July 27th. Created by Mark Ghosh in 2007, the site aimed to be the primary location for employers looking for professional WordPress help. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPJobsSite.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPJobsSite.jpg?resize=500%2C262\" alt=\"WP Jobs Website\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7986\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote><p>The site is intended to be used as the primary location for employers looking for professional WordPress help to post their needs and for WordPress professionals to find, apply for and obtain jobs in WordPress. We have focused on aesthetics, ease of use and consolidation of resources in developing WordPress Jobs. Feeds are available for every job category to make it easy for job seekers to find and apply for the right jobs as quickly as possible.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt had a hand in getting the site launched in 2007. Coming around full-circle, Matt has the opportunity to once again continue the legacy that is the original Jobs.WordPress.Net website. As <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/\" title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/meta/2013/07/17/seeking-2-moderators-for-jobs-wordpress-net/\">announced on the Make.WordPress.org website</a>, there has been a call for volunteer moderators for the website. The jobs board is still a popular destination but the amount of work required for one individual is daunting. The post outlines what is involved with the moderation process and the type of skills necessary to complete the work. It&#8217;s very encouraging to see that a number of people have already stepped up to help moderate this new community resource. </p>\n<p>On a WordPress jobs related note, PostStat.us just published their Summer edition of <a href=\"http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/\" title=\"http://poststat.us/whos-hiring-in-wordpress-summer-edition/\">Who&#8217;s Hiring In WordPress</a>.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/rvPCII3G3WU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 Jul 2013 16:39:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-17-2013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/ZJ6X6SqnVx0/the-daily-plugin-for-07-17-2013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8046:\"<p>We start early in the morning every day. Like the farmer extracting fresh eggs from his trusted hens, we&#8217;re up at the crack of dawn to examine the quality of each new plugin submitted to the WordPress Plugin Repository. Some are Grade A Extra Large, some are just a cracked shell with nothing inside. Either way, let&#8217;s get cracking and whip up today&#8217;s Daily Plugin Omelette. Remember that not all plugins play well with others. Make sure you test them on a secondary staging site before you take anything to a live site. We preach it, we live it. Follow our example and you&#8217;ll be thankful. OK, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title=\"First Google Map\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/first-google-map/\" target=\"_blank\">First Google Map</a> employs one of my favorite slogans, &#8220;Keep It Simple&#8221;. Often times when we&#8217;re trying to insert a simple Google map, the plugins or embed code we use is too bloated, doesn&#8217;t display titles correctly or are too difficult to set up ahead of time. In comes &#8220;First Google Map&#8221; that allows you to insert a plain language formatted address to display your Google Map. The shortcode is rather simple and uses common sense taxonomy in its options. For example, if you wanted to show Mr. Mullenweg&#8217;s new rumored Tony Stark style mansion location, simply enter: [googlemap title=\'Matt\'s Beachfront Cottage\' width=450 height=300 zoom=14]31250 Broad Beach Rd, Malibu, CA[/googlemap] and the map will embed inline in your content area with appropriate overlay title of your choosing. Pretty nice way to insert on the fly. I could not find a direct option to choose the &#8220;satellite&#8221; view option over the standard road-only mode, which was the only real drawback. Other than that, it would be nice to have more control over the size of the address font that overlays the map. Most addresses that I tried were hyphenated by the plugin because the font was too large and it flowed into the next line. Control over these elements would be great, even if just another call-out function from within the shortcode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7960\" alt=\"Wp-chart-generator sample output\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Wp-chart-generator.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" /></a><a title=\"WP Chart Generator\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-chart-generator/\" target=\"_blank\">WP Chart Generator</a> helps to embed an on-the fly 3D pie chart with multiple options, an automatic key and a nice hover dialogue that highlights each section when the user moves their mouse over the graph. The developer may need assistance converting this to English, as it&#8217;s completely in French. Fortunately, it&#8217;s so easy to use that the language barrier really didn&#8217;t make much difference. The shortcode is pretty easy to create within the plugin options, which allows you to copy the correct shortcode to embed within your posts. In the past I&#8217;ve used Google chart API callouts for embedding simple graphs, but for pie charts, this one takes the cake!</p>\n<p><a title=\"GSpeech\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/gspeech/\" target=\"_blank\">GSpeech</a> is a text to speech plugin that uses Google to read selected text aloud. At first I thought it would be just one of those &#8220;Type Something in the box and I&#8217;ll read it&#8221; type of plugins. I was sorely inaccurate. This plugin can incorporate full speech to read when certain scenarios occur, such as hovering over a tab to hear the tab&#8217;s navigation title read out loud. There are also hover-on, hover-off possibilities as well. When a site visitor hovers over the &#8220;about us&#8221; page, perhaps it can just start reading your bio aloud. It&#8217;s an interesting plugin for serving those with eyesight disabilities, but also an ideal educational platform as well. It may be used in combination with a gallery for a &#8220;storybook&#8221; type presentation. Even job training could be utilized using this kind of plugin to read instructions out loud. Great effort from those at <a title=\"2Glux\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/2glux/\" target=\"_blank\">2Glux</a> who developed this.</p>\n<p><a title=\"I Recommend This\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/i-recommend-this/\" target=\"_blank\">I Recommend This</a> scales back our traditional feedback mechanism by removing comments and relying on a simple &#8220;like&#8221; system instead. Included in the plugin is widget functionality that can display the most popular &#8220;liked&#8221; posts. Cookies are also utilized to prevent abuse of users over-liking your posts. You have the option to not show all the ZERO likes that you may have on your post. Once you get a like, it starts displaying on the post. Nice way to hide all the goose eggs (zeroes) that will be blatantly mocking you while you or other users browse through your site. It&#8217;s a good alternative to some of the mainstream Twitter/FB likes or the standard thumbs up / thumbs down ratings plugins that are out there. The developer <a title=\"Dreams Media\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/dreamsmedia/\" target=\"_blank\">Dreams Media</a> really thought it through with IP logging and Cookie tracking to prevent abuse. Additionally you can remove the IP logging to save system resources. Worth a try if you want to keep a fully enclosed like system to replace comments. Good for business sites that may not want to allow commenting, yet show a favorable presentation that someone out there likes their content. Great recently updated plugin.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Easy Albums for BuddyPress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s.wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/screenshot-4.jpg?resize=180%2C178\" /></a><a title=\"Easy Albums for BuddyPress\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-easy-albums-photos-video-and-music-next-gen/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Albums</a> is a new plugin for BuddyPress that allows the user base to upload their own audio files, playlists, images and videos to be displayed and organized in their own personalized albums. Not only does this allow a lot of media functionality from your user base, but it encourages commenting from other users as well. From an activity stream perspective, each user&#8217;s new media posts are shown within the timeline. While I love the functionality and flexibility that this all provides, the problem with this plugin from my perspective is that is requires a login from a third-party hosting server that the media is uploaded to. It is nearly perfect otherwise. A fully supported WPMU and Buddypress solution for full user media participation. Ideal for social and business applications of BuddyPress alike. If we could tie it to our own hosting or from Amazon or Dropbox without the additional login, I would gladly pay the developer <a title=\"Itaynoy\" href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/itaynoy/\" target=\"_blank\">Itaynoy</a> a premium for it.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s all the eggs in the basket for now. Looks like we had a good batch today! We&#8217;ll be up and at &#8216;em bright and early tomorrow in search of the newest and noteworthy plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository.

Some of these items are highlighted below, and a full changelog for 1.8 is available <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/releases/version-1-8/\">on the BP Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Better theme integration</em></p>\n<p>Since BuddyPress 1.7, BP has been compatible with practically every WordPress theme. But traces of the BuddyPress Default theme were still everywhere to be seen, in particular concerning the way that buttons, fonts, and form elements were styled. In BuddyPress 1.8, we&#8217;ve made a thorough review of our stylesheets to make them more minimal &#8211; we call it a &#8220;de-theming&#8221; &#8211; so that BP inherits CSS styling more gracefully from the active WordPress theme. We&#8217;re thrilled with how seamlessly BuddyPress 1.8 integrates with a variety of WordPress themes, and we think you&#8217;ll be thrilled too.</p>\n<p><em>Template hierarchy</em></p>\n<p>One of the most powerful tools available to WordPress theme developers is <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy\">template hierarchy</a>, which defines a set of file naming conventions for context-specific template overrides. BP 1.8 extends this concept to top-level BuddyPress templates &#8211; the templates that are first located when loading a BuddyPress page. Let&#8217;s say, for instance, that you want your Groups directory to have a single-column layout, while the rest of your BuddyPress content has a right-hand sidebar. Simply create a single-column page template in your theme at <code>buddypress/groups/index-directory.php</code>, and BuddyPress will use this file, instead of the fallback <code>page.php</code>, when loading the Groups directory. Documentation of this new feature can be found <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/theme-development/template-hierarchy/\">on the Codex</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Developer goodies</em></p>\n<p>1.8 is loaded with improvements aimed at making it easier and more fun than ever to develop for the BuddyPress platform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The popular <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/plugin-development/group-extension-api/\">Groups Extension API</a> has seen a complete rewrite, fixing long-standing bugs, adding new configuration options, and dramatically streamlining the process of extending <code>BP_Group_Extension</code>.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/developer-docs/loops-reference/the-activity-stream-loop/\">activity</a> and <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/developer-docs/loops-reference/the-groups-loop/\">groups</a> loops now support filtering by <code>\'meta_query\'</code>, using syntax familiar from <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Custom_Field_Parameters\">WP_Query</a>.</li>\n<li>Group member directories are powered by the new <code>BP_Group_Member_Query</code>, which extends the flexible tools of <code>BP_User_Query</code> to the Groups component.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/automated-testing/\">Automated testing</a> is now built into the trunk and stable Subversion versions of BuddyPress, complete with flexible tools for <a href=\"http://codex.buddypress.org/developer/automated-testing/writing-automated-tests-for-buddypress-dependent-plugins/\">testing BP-dependent plugins</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Artisans at work</h3>\n<p>In Midwood, Brooklyn, there&#8217;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiFara%27s\">a pizzeria</a> where every pie is handmade by a single septuagenarian, and diners can wait two hours or more for a pizza of their own. While the BuddyPress team doesn&#8217;t like to make anyone wait (the 1.8 dev cycle has been our shortest ever, with every milestone hit right on schedule), we <em>do</em> like to think that we bring passion and care to BuddyPress that&#8217;s similar to Dom DeMarco&#8217;s single-minded pizza-making. So, we&#8217;re proud to name BuddyPress 1.8 &#8220;Di Fara&#8221; after Dom&#8217;s classic pizza joint.</p>\n<h3>Thanks</h3>\n<p>As always, the BP core team extends appreciation to the scores of developers, designers, and community volunteers who have spent thousands of hours on this version of BuddyPress.

This is a recommended upgrade for all customers.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/news/2013/07/introducing-the-ramp-post-id-meta-translation-plugin/\">We also released</a> the <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-ramp-postid-meta-translation\">RAMP Post ID Meta Translation plugin (hosted on GitHub)</a> that should make RAMP even more useful for more complex sites. It gives you the ability to designate certain custom fields (by key) to be treated as post IDs and translated as part of the RAMP deploy process.</p>\n<p>This means if you have a plugin that is storing a post ID as post meta to indicate a relationship, or perhaps an additional image (attachment) ID as post meta, those can now be properly converted to point to the content deployed to your production site. This was probably the top requested feature for RAMP, so I&#8217;m thrilled to be able to make it available.</p>\n<p class=\"threads-post-notice\">This post is part of the project: <a href=\"http://alexking.org/project/ramp\">RAMP</a>.

Google Summer of Code student Frederick Ding has <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/16/migration-update-wxr-importer/\" title=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/07/16/migration-update-wxr-importer/\">published an update</a> on his progress working with the WXR Importer. In this update, Frederick will begin the process of updating the WordPress WXR Importer plugin.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve also run the unit tests that apply to the importer plugin; however, the test cases are generally small (indeed, the biggest XML test case is 26 KB, titled small-export.xml) and don’t trigger the kinds of issues that importing dozens or hundreds of posts and attachments—with WXR files of megabytes in size—does.</p>\n<p>So, the first task at hand is breaking up the process—which currently executes in one step with little indication of progress—into discrete chunks that can run in separate, stateful (stepwise) requests.</p>\n<p>A chat with my mentors has pointed me in the direction of WP_Importer_Cron, which was first developed for other importers that need to make external API calls (e.g. Tumblr Importer) potentially subject to rate constraints. There are some parallels between “external API calls” and “remote attachment fetching”, which is why this can be a suitable approach for fixing the timeout issues that present with the current WordPress importer. After the process is discretized, showing progress (an enhancement long overdue) will be easier.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m stoked to see Frederick not only concentrating on the functionality of the importer but also paying attention to the visual details such as showing import progress. There are a lot of eyeballs keeping track of this plugin hoping that Frederick&#8217;s work will pay off in an importer that does what it&#8217;s supposed to with minimal problems. I want to remind Frederick that if you need people to beta test your work, especially in the area of large export/imports, just say so.

In the interview, we learn the origin of his nickname Otto. However, I think one of the most interesting points in the interview are Otto&#8217;s thoughts on plugins. </p>\n<blockquote><p>If I have 100 plugins all doing their own thing, and I just combine them all into one file somewhere, then the code remains the same and there’s no advantages in doing so. Having them separate, with their own names, and their own descriptions, provides a way to keep track of things. I use snippets a lot too, but I put each snippet into its own plugin, for simplicity of management.</p>\n<p>The number of plugins doesn’t matter, the code is what matters, and where that code lives is unimportant. WordPress itself implements a lot of its own internal functionality in the same way a plugin would do so.</p></blockquote>\n<p>His response has been very consistent over the years. In 2011, he pretty much <a href=\"http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719\" title=\"http://wpcandy.com/thinks/active-plugin-counts-just-dont-matter/#comment-198719\">provided the same answer</a> when Ryan Imel of WPCandy published an article about the same topic. I also chimed in on this topic in 2011 where I discussed <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity\" title=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-quality-not-plugin-quantity\">Plugin Quality, not Plugin Quantity</a>. This is one of those things in the world of WordPress that I&#8217;ve seen change over the past few years. The line of thought used to be that you could only run so many plugins before you ran into problems or, you shouldn&#8217;t run more than a certain amount. I&#8217;m glad to see this urban myth slowly but surely, being put to rest. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/pGttwMFAC0o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 Jul 2013 11:00:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"Mark Jaquith: Six Apart Suspends Movable Type Open Source Project\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/?p=4127\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2013/07/16/six-apart-suspends-movable-type-open-source-project/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2670:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.movabletype.org/2013/07/license_change_on_movable_type_6.html\">Six Apart announced</a> that they are suspending the free and open source version of Movable Type.

If a project has a strong open source development community, an attempt to close it down should result in a fork of the project. As it happens, Movable Type Open Source was already forked. Several prominent Movable Type people created <a href=\"http://openmelody.org/\">Open Melody</a> back in 2009. Don&#8217;t bother clicking that link. As of this writing the site is non-operational.

Not only will it continue to run, but it’s also now completely free to use. There is even now an option in Lean Domain Search to register domain names directly through WordPress.com, making it easier than ever to start a website with a great domain name.</p></blockquote>\n<p>LeanDomainSearch specializes in quick and easy domain searches. I took it for a test spin to see what other domains I could buy with the word <strong>Tavern</strong> in them. Turns out, quite a few. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TavernSearch.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/TavernSearch.jpg?resize=500%2C144\" alt=\"Lean Domain Search Results\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7930\" /></a></p>\n<p>The search results are lightning fast and the color coded legend makes it easy to see which domains are available to be registered. Among the domain registration options are GoDaddy, NameCheap, and WordPress.com. The domain search also checks to see if that name is available on Twitter. When you click on the WordPress.com option, the domain field will automatically be filled in with that domain name. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/SuperTavern.jpg?resize=407%2C278\" alt=\"Super Tavern\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7931\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thanks to the acquisition, the <a href=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/\" title=\"http://en.support.wordpress.com/domains/register-domain/\">following WordPress.com support page</a> will need to be updated to explain how to use the newly acquired services to search for available names. </p>\n<p>Congratulations to Matt Mazur on being acqui-hired and becoming yet another Matt that is employed by Automattic.

It allows me to assign an author to a post without having to create an additional user account. </p>\n<p><strong>What plugins do you use to make working with multiple authors easier?</strong></p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0IxUcSBfgQc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 20:21:15 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WordPress.tv: Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=20169\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:678:\"<div id=\"v-BbT5MxHY-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/20169/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=20169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/07/15/brent-toderash-finding-the-right-wordpress-plugin/\"><img alt=\"Brent Toderash: Finding the Right WordPress Plugin\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/BbT5MxHY/video-7f2e5fd1c6_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 15 Jul 2013 19:25:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"Alex King: My Content-Powered Projects Page\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://alexking.org/?p=17747\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/15/content-powered-projects-page\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7147:\".threads-post-notice {\n	background: #e8e8e8;\n	padding: 10px;\n}\n.threads-post-notice a {\n	font-weight: bold;\n}\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2013/07/07/reorganizing\">alluded to earlier</a>, I&#8217;ve cleaned up my <a href=\"http://alexking.org/projects\">projects page</a> which is now powered by a new taxonomy, custom post type and the content I&#8217;ve generated here over the last decade plus. Turns out, I&#8217;ve generated quite a few projects. <img src=\"http://alexking.org/wp/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif\" alt=\":)\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> </p>\n<p><img src=\"http://alexking.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/projects-page-crop-510x382.png\" alt=\"projects-page-crop\" width=\"480\" height=\"359\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium-img wp-image-17781\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not completely done creating and managing the content, but I&#8217;m pretty happy with the improvement. I&#8217;ve tried to group them in ways that are useful &#8211; especially calling out projects that are no longer active<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>.</p>\n<p>You can see a comparison of the old and new pages in <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexkingorg/sets/72157634631433509/\">this Flickr set</a>.</p>\n<p>So what did I do and how did I do it?</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-17747\"></span></p>\n<p><em>Note: This was written against a pre-release version of WordPress 3.6</em></p>\n<h3>1. Create a Projects Taxonomy (and Post Type)</h3>\n<p>I created two new taxonomies to power the Projects page.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Projects: the names of my various projects.</li>\n<li>Project Groups: to group my projects into buckets.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991273\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I then used the <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a> <a href=\"https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-tax-post-binding\">taxonomy-to-post binding plugin</a> plugin to create a Project post type that is effectively a child of the Projects taxonomy. This way I will be able to add content, terms, featured images, etc. to my projects (in a very forward compatible way).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991284\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>2. Convert existing Categories and Threads to Projects</h3>\n<p>In my existing content structures I had both categories and <a href=\"http://alexking.org/project/threads\">threads</a> that were dedicated to specific projects. I needed to convert those relationships to the new projects taxonomy I&#8217;d created.</p>\n<p>Changing the categories was straightforward, but there was a little more work for the threads because I needed to convert the related post types as well. I did separate SQL queries to get the various category and thread ids I needed to convert.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991297\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>Once everything was converted, I then ran a little code to save each term via the WordPress API so that the associated project post types content would be created (via the tax-post-binding library).</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991324\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>The existing terms are now fully converted to projects.</p>\n<h3>3. Create New Projects (with meta data)</h3>\n<p>Now that I had converted the existing categories and threads to projects, it was time to create the rest of the projects. I ended up creating a big array with lots of meta data so that I could run and test this locally, then replay it all on my live site.</p>\n<p>This code creates the new project groups taxonomy terms, the new project terms, and adds meta data to the associated project post types.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991315\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I truncated that quite a bit as I inserted a <em>lot</em> of projects.</p>\n<h3>4. Assign Existing Posts to Projects</h3>\n<p>At this point we have all of our project terms and post types created, it&#8217;s time to use them.</p>\n<p>Finding the posts I wanted to put into each project wasn&#8217;t an exact science. I basically created a projects list, then did searches on my site to find the posts relevant to that project. Then I manually selected the post IDs for those posts, and put them into a big array.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991399\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t select the posts programatically because there&#8217;s a bit more nuance to choosing what is and isn&#8217;t applicable to a project than just a keyword search.</p>\n<p>As part of that process, I also added a &#8220;Projects&#8221; category to all of these posts. I use this to show links to the latest posts across all projects on the new page. I needed to add this category to all of the converted categories and threads too.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991415\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<h3>5. Expose the New Data to Create the Projects Page</h3>\n<p>With all of my data set up, the last step was to expose it to power the projects page. I decided to do this by creating a shortcode that would output the projects by group.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/5991434\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>This has a bit too much of a mix of template and presentation for my liking, but it works and refactoring it is pretty low on my list at this point. Next time I mess with that code, I&#8217;ll probably clean it up a bit.</p>\n<h3>6. Project Page</h3>\n<p>The final step in the process was to customize the output of the individual project page. I am outputting the description, related links and featured image from the bound post type, and I converted some of my Threads plugin code to show a timeline of posts in &#8220;newest first&#8221; order. I also added a &#8220;this post is part of a project&#8221; banner to the individual posts, again borrowing the code from the Threads plugin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s <a href=\"http://alexking.org/project/social\">an example</a>.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I feel like the new <a href=\"http://alexking.org/projects\">projects page</a> is a better representation of my projects, and will be more meaningful and maintainable in the future than the old static page was. It will also reward me for blogging more frequently by being more up to date as a result.</p>\n<p>All good things.</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn:1\">\nMore on this in a future post.&#160;<a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:1\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn:2\">\nI probably could have done this earlier in the process, but didn&#8217;t think of the feature I wanted it for until later.&#160;<a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fnref:2\" rev=\"footnote\">&#8617;</a>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p class=\"threads-post-notice\">This post is part of the thread: <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/thread/content\">Content Presentation</a> &#8211; an ongoing story on this site.

With just 30 minutes to go before it becomes Saturday on the East coast, <a title=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/07/wordpress-3-6-release-candidate/\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/07/wordpress-3-6-release-candidate/\">3.6 RC 1 has arrived</a>. This gets us one big step closer to getting 3.6 out in the wild. There is no link yet to the Post Formats UI plugin. I know many are hoping to see that come soon after 3.6 is released. In the mean time, the revisions area of WordPress has seen a major refactoring that has created a substantial increase in performance when dealing with hundreds of revisions.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We hope to ship WordPress 3.6 in a couple weeks.

If any known issues come up, you’ll be able to <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/report/6\">find them here</a>. <strong>Developers,</strong> please test your plugins and themes, so that if there is a compatibility issue, we can sort it out before the final release.</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.6, try the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

He recently <a href=\"http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/\" title=\"http://danielespinoza.me/selling-plugins-to-get-out-of-debt/\">published his personal quest</a> to conquer non-mortgage debt by selling his plugins. The debt amounted to $67,000 and he was able to pay it off in just 8 months. He is now creating an emergency fund equal to six months of income. But how did he conquer that monster the majority of us know as debt? He made the tough choice to sell two of the first plugins he ever developed despite them bringing in 4-5 thousand dollars in monthly recurring revenue. The plugins he sold were Authorize.net, AIM, and PayPal Express.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We were sick and tired of our debt hindering us from being able to follow our passion of slow travel with our family as digital tentmakers. Our one goal became cleaning up our financial mess and removing that hurdle. So when we received the offer to sell we asked “Does this get us to our goal?” and the answer was “Yes.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Congratulations Daniel on beheading the monster that is debt. I hope your story serves as inspiration for many others to accomplish the same feat. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/KpDYhG6qWAE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 Jul 2013 02:54:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"WPTavern: Week In WordPress Episode 5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7880\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/fFKmu2bWXUA/week-in-wordpress-episode-5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1020:\"<p>I invite you to watch <a title=\"http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/\" href=\"http://slocumstudio.com/2013/07/week-in-wordpress-episode-5/\">Week In WordPress Episode 5</a> as yours truly and a group of WordPress faithful got together to discuss the news of the week.

Some people clip coupons, some collect stamps or dog trinkets. I dig through plugins. Lots of &#8216;em. The most mentionable are listed here in what we like to call The Daily Plugin. While I don&#8217;t consider this everyday offering to be a review, it&#8217;s certainly a spotlight on what plugins I feel the community can get the most usage out of. Your own circumstances and needs apply. Remember that these plugins are always to be tested on staging and development sites first as to not risk losing data or compromise speed or functionality when used in conjunction with your existing plugin set. OK, Let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a title=\"Similar Sites Menu\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/similar-sites-menu/\" target=\"_blank\">Similar Sites Menu</a> is an external sites &#8220;link menu&#8221; that acts as a secondary native menu in your top navigation bar. If you happen to run a sub domain or have sister sites this could be a really good option in which you can promote everything on the top-level. The theme that I tested this on did not play nice with the plugin when it came to CSS styling and matching the overall look and feel of my WordPress installation. However when I tested it on a secondary staging site they work great without any complications. I was able to edit the color scheme to match the site perfectly in just under three minutes. Any theme with a secondary menu could accomplish this task as well, but it&#8217;s nice to have another option when you need it.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Random Images\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/random-images/\" target=\"_blank\">Random Images</a> shows off the featured images within posts in a nice layout with uniformly sized thumbnails. When a thumbnail is clicked the plugin calls up a lightbox version of the enlarged image is shown with a link to the content item on top of the image. While I found that the functionality and overall design of this plugin was very appealing, the lightbox itself was not the result I was expecting. For the purposes of my own sites and content that resides within them, I would rather see this plugin serve the capacity in showing full post content rather than just images. I&#8217;m sure that this could be accomplished with just a bit of code revision, in addition to options of sharing the posts via social networking platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n<p><a title=\"TSP Featured Posts\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/tsp-featured-posts/\" target=\"_blank\">TSP Featured Posts</a> from The Software People gives you the opportunity to show off your posts in a simple Layout that can be easily managed and manipulated through shortcodes. After installing the plugin you make a determination as to your default thumbnail size and the length of the excerpt of the post that you&#8217;d like to display. Once all of those vital statistics have been entered into the system, you simply choose the category you&#8217;d like to display, how many posts you like, and the plugin does all the rest. This is a pretty good plugin for people who would like to tweak the themes without having to go through major code overhaul. There are certainly a number of themes that have this functionality built within the framework, but not all of them. I found this to be an excellent first entry from this particular developer and will be highlighting a few more plugins that they have released this week in the days that follow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7870\" alt=\"CSV-Test\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/CSV-Test.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a><a title=\"CSV to Sort Table\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/csv-to-sorttable/\" target=\"_blank\">CSV to SortTable</a> has been recently updated, and it&#8217;s turning into the kind of plugin that may have more usage than the developer even intended. The plugin functions by calling an external CSV file from a URL of your choosing and transforms it into a sortable HTML table. It&#8217;s simple to do on a per post basis in the form of an easy shortcode, such as <strong>[csv src=http://example.com/myfile.csv], </strong>showing the direct path to the file. There are other shortcode options as well, like hiding/showing the top or bottom rows, etc. I tested this on a few different CSV files with great success. The tables all looked great right out of the gate with little modification. So how does this plugin work and what can be expanded from it? Well I tried a few scenarios. The first thing that I did was try to make changes to an already uploaded CSV file to see if it would update on the fly. It did. So we know that it updates the file in real-time. This can be good and bad. Good because it always has the newest data. Bad because it&#8217;s always trying to download and convert that file on the fly. The load time wasn&#8217;t worth abandoning the plugin over, so I tried a few more &#8220;hacks&#8221; to see if I could expand the range even further. I took the same CSV file and saved it to a local dropbox folder. Then I went to the Dropbox site to get a private link to the csv file. This worked! I imported straight from Dropbox. The one issue I had is that I then went back and made a few changes to the file and re-saved in Dropbox. Even after editing and re-synching the folder, the new revisions did not &#8220;take&#8221; with the plugin. It could be a cache issue or something on the end of Dropbox, but it&#8217;s a good idea for the developer to think about using services like Google Drive and Dropbox to feed the CSV source path. I would love the ability to edit files on the fly and have them self-update into pricing or product tables in near real-time. It&#8217;s almost perfect and certainly works well as intended. It would be nice to connect a few more pipes to it though.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Buddypress XProfile Custom Fields Type\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-xprofile-custom-fields-type/\" target=\"_blank\">Buddypress Xprofile Custom Fields Type</a> helps to add more user functionality and community within your BuddyPress installation. It allows several custom fields to be used in reference to your users, such as the user&#8217;s birthday, email address, custom post type selector results, image fields, check box acceptances (for terms of service or rules acknowledgement) and other custom fields of your choosing. It also provides the user with the option to hide or show selected information on their user profile. All the fields work within the BP Profile Search plugin, so the information becomes completely searchable. I&#8217;m relatively new to BuddyPress, having created only a few small-scale private member sites. Any help that can come in the form of easy to configure fields and user options is always a welcome relief. If you are in the same boat that I am regarding editing and managing BuddyPress, you&#8217;ll appreciate the flexibility that this plugin provides.</p>\n<p>Thank you once again for joining me in another edition of The Daily Plugin.

(Posting it is a great idea by the way, people will help you with it.) I began to think about mine, which was a little strange because I&#8217;ve been trying to move away from desiring things or experiences and just be more grateful in the present, but immediately a few music ones came to mind: have WordPress name-checked in a major hip-hop song, be in a rap video, and perform with one of my favorite artists (somehow).</p>\n<p>It was less than a week later I got an email from a friend who was helping organize a hush-hush event where Jay-Z would sing his song Picasso Baby over and over 6 hours while interacting with various artists and an audience as a performance piece, and there might even be an opportunity to be one of the people he interacted with. My jaw dropped.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-42718\"></span></p>\n<p>The entire experience was fairly surreal, <a href=\"http://www.vulture.com/2013/07/jerry-saltz-face-to-face-with-jay-z.html\">this article by Jerry Saltz captured it well</a>, and in the end I did get to &#8220;perform&#8221; (in a very loose performance art sense) directly with Jay (we&#8217;re on a first syllable basis now), <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshm/status/355090504586776576\">which was even caught in a photo</a>. An hour into the event I couldn&#8217;t find any trace of it on Twitter or blogs. I brought my Nikon D3S to the event and snapped a few photos, some of which of his performance with Marina Abramovic turned out really well. If I could do it again the only thing I&#8217;d do differently is try and get portraits of more of the amazing artists who were there, from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andres_Serrano\">Andres Serrano</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Peyton\">Elizabeth Peyton</a>.

href=\"https://wpremote.com/\" title=\"https://wpremote.com/\">WPRemote</a> is a quick and easy way to monitor multiple websites all for the price of free. However, they&#8217;ve recently launched a $5.00 per month/per site automatic backup plan. I caught up with the founders of this small service to see what their plans were for the future. </p>\n<p><strong>What is WP Remote and why did you decide to start the service?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote1.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote1.jpg?resize=500%2C106\" alt=\"Track All Your Sites\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7706\" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Remote is a service for monitoring and updating all of your WordPress sites. Human Made built the initial version a few years back out of necessity — a way of streamlining the repetitive tasks associated with managing our many client sites. We received positive feedback on WP Remote from those we showed it to, and decided to invest a bit of time releasing a public version.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s all included in the free account?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote2.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote2.jpg?resize=500%2C122\" alt=\"Daily Automatic Backups\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7707\" /></a></p>\n<p>WP Remote will monitor your WordPress sites for updates to plugins, theme, and WordPress core. If it finds any out of date software, you can update individually or all at once. WP Remote also lets you perform an on-demand backup of an entire site. Signing up is easy, so go ahead and give it a try.</p>\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to offer a free account?</strong></p>\n<p>Much of the community is built on sharing what you know and have. We thought making WP Remote publicly available was an appropriate way for us to contribute back.</p>\n<p><strong>How does this service differ from VaultPress or some of the other security monitoring services?</strong></p>\n<p>WP Remote doesn’t do any security monitoring at this time. We’re focusing on the best functionality for managing your WordPress sites.</p>\n<p><strong>Can you provide some of the technical details involved with the backups such as where they are stored and what makes them secure?</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote3.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WPRemote3.jpg?resize=421%2C133\" alt=\"Serious About Security\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7708\" /></a></p>\n<p>On your web host, the backup file is first generated with our open source HM Backup library. Our on-demand backup feature then streams the backup file from your web host to your computer. On the other hand, our premium Automatic Backups feature stores your backup file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket that we manage, making it very easy for users who are looking for a hands off approach.</p>\n<p><strong>How are you able to offer such a service at such an affordable price?</strong></p>\n<p>It’s been a labor of love so far. We’d like to invest much more time into improving WP Remote though. To help us justify this investment, we plan to introduce additional features worth paying for (a cost that you can also pass on to your clients).</p>\n<p><strong>Are there plans in the future to add the ability to be able to automatically restore a site from a backup?</strong></p>\n<p>No set plans, but restoring a site from backup (or cloning an existing site) is a feature we’d love as well. We do have a handy guide for people who want to restore their site from a backup. We’re always looking for people to check out WP Remote and send us feedback.</p>\n<p><strong>What’s been the most common feedback you’ve received from your customers?</strong></p>\n<p>Funny you ask! We ran a survey just last week — one common request is for an email notification when you have a plugin or theme to update. We think this would be neat, and it would be even cooler to have WP Remote automatically upgrade plugins and themes it knew were safe to upgrade.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the long term goal of WP Remote?</strong></p>\n<p>To build a smart, intuitive application to manage our WordPress sites so we don’t have to. In doing so, we hope others grow to love WP Remote as much as we do. We are also working to expose an external API for WP Remote so developers can better integrate their own tools with us. We are pretty excited about the potential.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/5HKzkOgsY1A\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 22:22:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"WPTavern: Page.ly Launches New CDN Called PressCDN\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7855\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/yr-eYAEMv0c/page-ly-launches-new-cdn-called-presscdn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3156:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PressCDNLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/PressCDNLogo.jpg?resize=300%2C69\" alt=\"PressCDN Logo\" class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-7856\" /></a>Page.ly <a title=\"http://blog.page.ly/2013/07/presscdn-the-cdn-for-those-that-love-wordpress/\" href=\"http://blog.page.ly/2013/07/presscdn-the-cdn-for-those-that-love-wordpress/\">has announced</a> a brand new CDN service called PressCDN. Page.ly has partnered with a number of companies in order to provide a global distribution network. The biggest selling point they are pushing is speed. For those that don&#8217;t know, CDN stands for Content Delivery Network.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A CDN is a content delivery network that stores copies of your images and site files in locations all around the world. This allows them to be downloaded to your visitor’s computer faster, speeding up the overall load time of your page.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At $9 dollars per month, it&#8217;s a cheap way to speed up a website but it&#8217;s not cheaper than free. <a title=\"http://jetpack.me/support/photon/\" href=\"http://jetpack.me/support/photon/\">Photon</a>, which is one of the services built into the Jetpack plugin provides CDN capabilities. When enabled, images will be served dynamically from the servers that power the WordPress.com cloud. However, Photon does have its limitations. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Photon filters content but doesn’t change the info in the database.</li>\n<li>Photon currently only acts on images in posts and featured images (post thumbnails).</li>\n<li>Photon will apply to old posts and new ones alike and can be turned on or off easily.</li>\n<li>No cache invalidations – currently the images are cached “forever”. If you want to “refresh” an image you will need to change the name of the image.&nbsp;Adding random query arguments, commonly known as cachebusters, will not work.</li>\n<li>We only fetch, resize, and serve&nbsp;<strong>gif, png, and jpg</strong>&nbsp;images from servers that listen on&nbsp;<strong>port 80</strong>. This is about 99.99% of the web servers in the world.</li>\n<li>We will not “upscale” an image in most circumstances.&nbsp;If your original image is 1000px wide and you ask for us to make it 5000px, we will serve you the original 1000px image.&nbsp;Upscaled images are usually of poor quality and we want to avoid that.</li>\n<li>If your server takes longer than 10 seconds to upload the image to Photon, the upload will time out and your image will appear to be broken. Try to upload a differently-named image with a smaller file size if this happens.</li>\n<li>Animated gifs will probably break if resized or transformed via Photon.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On paper, using any type of CDN is supposed to be beneficial to both the site and its visitors. However, until we see some comparison benchmarks preferably from a third-party comparing speeds and services like PressCDN with Photon, we&#8217;ll never know.</p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/yr-eYAEMv0c\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 20:49:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 1.8 – Release Candidate 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://buddypress.org/?p=167934\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"http://buddypress.org/2013/07/buddypress-1-8-release-candidate-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1025:\"<p>BuddyPress 1.8 is so close you can smell it!

Since long form content has generated some of the most interest and engagement on the site, the redesign features a left-handed column devoted exclusively to the long form content while the right-hand sidebar will contain the typical links that visitors are accustomed to. This enables the long form content to stick around longer without being buried by the different content types. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RedesignPreview.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/RedesignPreview.png?resize=500%2C345\" alt=\"Post Status Redesign Preview\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-7848\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another large piece of the revamped site gives us a glimpse as to one of the ways Brian is looking to monetize the site. With the redesign, he has entered an exclusive 3-month partnership with <a href=\"http://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress/\" title=\"http://thethemefoundry.com/wordpress/\">The Theme Foundry</a>. The ad is non-obtrusive, and blends into the site rather well. </p>\n<p>Overall, the design is crisp, clean, and easy on the eyes. Brian did a nice job.

Be warned, the following video has occasional strong language. </p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p>Overall, another great episode by the Dradcast team. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/MMapgZH6yHg\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 11:00:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"WPTavern: The Daily Plugin for 07-10-2013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7623\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/9_CGK-i4pmA/the-daily-plugin-for-07-10-2013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7120:\"<p>Welcome once again to The Daily Plugin, where we take a look at the newest and most frequently updated plugins from the WordPress Plugin Repository. Remember to install new plugins on a staging site first as to not expose your valuable sites to any risk of plugin conflict or crashes of your site. Also please consider that these plugins are not rated or suggested in any official capacity. This is merely my reaction to the latest plugins to be released. With that being said, let&#8217;s get plugged in!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-7826\" alt=\"Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Easy-Responsive-Tabs-to-Accordion.png?resize=150%2C150\" /></a><a title=\"Easy Responsive Tabs To Accordion\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-easy-responsive-tabs-to-accordion/\" target=\"_blank\">Easy Responsive Tabs to Accordion</a> is a visually appealing way to add a tab/content component to your responsive WordPress site. This is a lightweight jQuery plugin which optimizes normal horizontal or vertical tabs to accordion on multiple devices for Desktop browsers, tablets and Mobile viewing. This plugin adapts the screen size and changes its action accordingly. I found the display options to be very configurable and highly attractive. There have been a lot of tab plugins released in the last several months, but this is the first one that I&#8217;ve seen that is actually completely responsive. It has a high degree of added ability when it comes to editing CSS. I had a complete set of tabs up and running to conform with the look of my site within 10 minutes. Not too shabby. So if you or your clients have been clamoring for a refresh on their website design, this element might help spruce things up a bit and give you added functionality to boot.</p>\n<p><a title=\"Featured Image from Google Images\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/featured-image-from-google-images/\" target=\"_blank\">Featured Image from Google Images</a> has some pretty intriguing elements to it. Rather than having you upload a featured image into the media gallery, you instead can simply search based on keyword and find results in the Google images pool. With just a few clicks you can add that image straight into your blog without having to download it and upload it ahead of time. While I think this is a pretty fantastic way to add images, I do worry about copyright infringement and the implications that it might bring about. Using Google images is often a shortcut that we&#8217;re all guilty of. We need to also remember that there are photographers behind those images that should also be compensated for their creativity and hard work. If you&#8217;re going to use a plugin like this I would encourage you to stick with what is generally accepted as public domain or Creative Commons licensed material. Otherwise you run the risk of getting into trouble (or getting your client in trouble) because someone down the line forgot to purchase a license agreement for the images used. I&#8217;ve seen it happen several times, so if you are going to use this add-on, make sure to use common sense in doing so. Here&#8217;s a video that summarizes the functionality and setup of this plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/meetup-winner/assets/screenshot-1.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"Meetup Winner! WordPress Plugin\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/meetup-winner/assets/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=207%2C159\" /></a><a title=\"Meetup Winner\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/meetup-winner/\" target=\"_blank\">Meetup Winner!</a> is a plugin that taps into the Meetup.com API. I&#8217;ve not run across anything that has Meetup API functionality in the past, so I decided to check this one out. The basis of this plugin is basically one that allows you to reward those who RSVP to one of your meetups. How it works is that you set up an event ID shortcode corresponding to your individual event. Once at the event, you can call up the page where the shortcut resides and the plugin will randomly pick from those who have RSVP to the meeting. It will display the person&#8217;s name and the picture associated with them at meetup.com. I find this quite encouraging that different plugins are being developed around meetup.com. <strong>Regarding Meetup.com:</strong> Though there are some questionable groups that can be found on the site, I have found invaluable resources and relationships garnered at my local Southern California WordPress meet up group, which happens to be the <a title=\"OC WordPress Group on Meetup.com\" href=\"http://www.meetup.com/OC-Wordpress-Group/\" target=\"_blank\">OC WordPress meetup</a> headed by <a title=\"Steve Zehngut on Twitter\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Zengy\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Zehngut</a>. With other power WP users like Jason Tucker and Suzette Franck, co-hosts on the weekly <a title=\"Wordpress Water Cooler\" href=\"http://www.wpwatercooler.com/\">WP WaterCooler</a> Hangout. It&#8217;s one of the more active among WP Meetups. I applaud the concept and integration of this plugin and look forward to even more Meetup.com WordPress integration in the future. Hopefully this also means I might win something at a future meetup!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/lateralpress/assets/screenshot-1.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignleft\" alt=\"LateralPress\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/s-plugins.wordpress.org/lateralpress/assets/screenshot-1.jpg?resize=151%2C137\" /></a><a title=\"LateralPress WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/lateralpress/\" target=\"_blank\">LateralPress</a> is an interesting java based design plugin that allows you to display an animated scrolling timeline of content relative to the post date and a custom post type modifier. I found this plugin to be quite visually appealing. However the JavaScript time did take a while to load in the test application that I tried on a staging site. While posts set up for previous posts to be included in this plugin&#8217;s display is a tedious process, the results are rather difficult to compete with when it comes to final output. I think this would be an excellent plugin for people who would like to tell a story with their content over an evolutionary period of time. It adds a lot of visual appeal to what would otherwise be a boring about us or bio page on your WordPress installation.</p>\n<p>Thank you for joining me in another installation of the Daily Plugin.

The move comes as a shock to many within the WordPress community, including me. WPDaily was spearheaded by John Saddington, leader of the development team <a title=\"http://8bit.io\" href=\"http://8bit.io\">8Bit</a> and project manager of <a title=\"http://pressgr.am/\" href=\"http://pressgr.am/\">PressGram</a>. While no direct cause of the shutdown was given, John noted that while the site achieved a variety of goals, it did not achieve the larger global goals and strategy of their organization at the present time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>We achieved every single goal and metric that we had set out to accomplish (and then some) in this glorious experiment and so we consider it a “success.” But, it did not achieve the much larger global goals and strategy of our organization at this present time.</p></blockquote>\n<p>One thing I can confirm is that criticism and negative reactions to some of their published content was definitely not a reason for the shutdown. I give John a lot of credit for everything he did with WPDaily. The man was a publishing machine and if you blinked, you missed a ton of content. I occasionally joked that John published so much content that he was the reason infinite scroll was invented. Everywhere I looked, I saw John Saddington with the first comment on posts. This just shows how much he was on the ball with information. I know from experience that the only way John could accomplish what he did with WPDaily involved ridiculously long hours, lots of typing, living within the inbox, and juggling his time with reviewing products and just being in touch with people. For anyone that thinks running a community news type website is easy, you&#8217;re wrong. It&#8217;s very difficult. It requires lots of time reading, communicating, piecing together stories, managing the conversations that take place and a host of other responsibilities. This is why I continue to think that if you don&#8217;t have a primary source of funding, that creating a site like WPDaily or WPTavern just isn&#8217;t worth it in the long run.</p>\n<p>However, the shutdown of WPDaily stirred up the conversation again around WordPress news sites and how they can be sustainable. According to one individual, the curation of WordPress content can not be achieved by 1 person or 10 but rather, <a title=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169\" href=\"https://twitter.com/wptavern/status/355084349428871169\">should be an automated process</a>. Then, you could charge access to the site as it would do all of the filtering for you. Hard to say if that idea would take off but the site I have in mind that could potentially make this work is <a title=\"http://poststat.us/\" href=\"http://poststat.us/\">PostStat.us</a>. Brian Krogsgard has <a title=\"https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256\" href=\"https://twitter.com/Krogsgard/status/355088909039968256\">stated on Twitter</a> that he has a few tricks up his sleeve to monetize the site but we will have to wait until they are implemented to find out what they are.</p>\n<p>I want to personally say to John Saddington that I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors and especially with PressGram. At the same time however, I make a formal request that you highly consider leaving the content archived somewhere for reference material or you either sell, or provide the archive to someone who is more concerned with the historical significance of the content than any other agenda.</p>\n<p>Last but not least, I want to thank the individuals who suggested to others that they can use WPTavern to get their fix for WordPress information. However, WPTavern can not and will not be a direct replacement for WPDaily. Both sites contain their own unique flavors, takes on various topics that come up in the community.</p>\n<p>*<strong>Update</strong>*<br />\nAs of July 11th 2013, the site has been turned back on and is in Archive mode. </p>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/GfJmcCF51tk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 Jul 2013 23:51:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 14:27:00 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:14:\"content-length\";s:6:\"176331\";s:10:\"connection\";s:5:\"close\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 25 Jul 2013 14:00:28 GMT\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:11:\"HIT lax 250\";s:13:\"accept-ranges\";s:5:\"bytes\";}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20130725142613\";}','no'),(129,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_867bd5c64f85878d03a060509cd2f92c','1374805620','no'),(130,'_transient_feed_mod_867bd5c64f85878d03a060509cd2f92c','1374762420','no'),(131,'_transient_timeout_dash_aa95765b5cc111c56d5993d476b1c2f0','1374805620','no'),(132,'_transient_dash_aa95765b5cc111c56d5993d476b1c2f0','<div class=\"rss-widget\"><ul><li><a class=\'rsswidget\' href=\'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/BAscCKypc38/the-daily-plugin-for-07-23-2013\' title=\'Welcome once again to another installment of The Daily Plugin.

In WPtouch Pro 3 we&#8217;ve redesigned them to be <em>even easier to use</em> and extremely lightweight— along with taking strides to better incorporate core WordPress admin philosophies and best practices.</p>\n<h2>Intuitive Settings Panel</h2>\n<p>We examined the behaviour of our users in the way they use our settings; the way they read what the settings mean; as well as the way that they move through steps and what they expect to see and do.</p>\n<p>This has been very helpful for us in determining what works and what doesn&#8217;t. Adding a settings panel may seem like something that&#8217;s not very complicated to implement— but it truly is. Too often <a href=\"http://www.wpmayor.com/plugin-reviews/wordpress-plugin-worst-practices/\">plugins and themes for WordPress suffer from lacklustre settings panels</a> that are cluttered, hard to understand, and poorly coded.</p>\n<p>We place great importance on the way we build settings in WPtouch Pro. The attention and detail we give it is equal to the attention and detail we give to our themes.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, when you buy WPtouch Pro as a customer <em>the product <strong>you</strong> use is the settings panel;</em> while <strong>your visitors</strong> enjoy the mobile version you&#8217;ve created.</p>\n<h2>Lightweight &#038; Speedy</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.bravenewcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/colors-500x302.jpg\" alt=\"colors\" width=\"500\" height=\"302\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17691\" /></p>\n<p><small><center>WPtouch Pro 3: Easy Branding Setup</center></small></p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also significantly optimized memory, file sizes and load times in WPtouch Pro 3. These improvements can be felt in both the settings panel <em>and</em> themes. The result? An incredibly fast admin panel experience that rivals the fastest load times that WordPress itself can muster!</p>\n<p>Give WPtouch Pro 3.0 a try and find out how simple it can be to create and customize the <strong>very best WordPress mobile experiences</strong> for your site visitors, customers or clients.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.bravenewcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/menus-500x302.jpg\" alt=\"menus\" width=\"500\" height=\"302\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-17692\" /></p>\n<p><small><center>WPtouch Pro 3: Easy Menu Setup</center></small></p>\n<p>Want to learn more about WPtouch Pro 3.0?

It was 2007 and the project entailed building several themes for <a title=\"Matthew Good\" href=\"http://www.matthewgood.org/\">matthewgood.org</a>. Dale decided a mobile theme should be included as a surprise add-on. Software engineer, Duane Storey, was enlisted to help out on the job, and the roots for the founding of BraveNewCode began to form.</p>\n<p>As Duane recalls, &#8220;I was actually working on the last pieces in a hotel room in Ottawa, and then I flew out to Toronto to meet Dale and for both of us to go to one of Matt&#8217;s shows at <a href=\"http://www.masseyhall.com/\">Massey Hall</a>.  I think it was the morning after when we met Matt in his hotel room and showed him how it all worked.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2008, WPtouch became available in the <a title=\"WPtouch in the WordPress Plugin Directory\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wptouch/\">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> and by mid-2009 was approaching 100,000 downloads. Towards the end of 2009 the plugin also became available at <a title=\"Wordpress.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">wordpress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Today WPtouch is one of the top 10 most downloaded plugins in the directory having been downloaded over 3,500,000 times, in March 2012 it was found to be one of the top 20 plugins used across 30,000 WordPress sites by <a title=\"Presstrends\" href=\"http://www.presstrends.io/top-20-plugins-used-across-30000-wordpress-sites/\">Presstrends</a>. In addition, <a title=\"WPtouch on Top WordPress Blogs\" href=\"http://www.bravenewcode.com/2012/04/wptouch-powers-31-of-the-top-mobile-powered-wordpress-blogs/\">recent research we performed</a> indicates it is used by over 30% of the top blogs using WordPress.</p>\n<p>Next month we&#8217;re celebrating the 4th anniversary of BraveNewCode, founded on a relationship  that began with the development of our flagship plugin, WPtouch.

In fact, there&#8217;s nothing farther from the truth.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9220\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/wordpress-seo-tips-to-avoid-search-engine-penalties/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9220\" alt=\"SEO Ultimate Indexing Tips\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/spiders.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"225\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">How to Block Bots for Optimal SEO</p></div>\n<p>In this post, we cover simple solutions to prevent redundant pages (pages with duplicate or minimal content) from getting indexed from the roving tarsus of search engine spiders.</p>\n<p>Search engines use a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model\">bag of words model</a> to deduce market-focus (<em>what each page is about</em>) and topicality and relevancy are often lost when boilerplate templates, category pages, tags or archives pages are left wide-open for spiders to crawl.</p>\n<p>By eliminating digital stragglers (thin pages), you’ll bolster your websites relevancy by having a higher percentage of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/seo-information-retrieval/\">unique indexed content</a>.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-9219\"></span></p>\n<p>While users might observe a tag page, a search engine is programmed to view that page as <b>redundant content</b> with very few classifiers to distinguish itself from the boilerplate template.</p>\n<p>In fact, this is one of the prime directives of the Google Panda algorithm<i> (to eliminate low quality content through normalization within a body of documents</i>) hence, pages like these often get ignored or suppressed.</p>\n<h3>Avoid Rookie SEO Blunders</h3>\n<p>Websites with a high percentage of duplicate or minimal content on pages (such as category, archives or tag pages) can trigger algorithmic suppression.</p>\n<p>If your an avid SEO and understand HTML then you could simply implement a meta-robots command such as <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/duplicate-content-and-seo/\">nofollow or noindex</a>, but unless you want to do that painstakingly page by page, you’ll need a plugin such as <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-ultimate/\">SEO Ultimate</a> (<strong>The Premiere All-In-One WordPress SEO Plugin</strong>) from <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/\">SEO Design Solutions</a> that allows you to quickly and easily implement control over robots (search engine spiders) and canonicalization on the fly.</p>\n<p>If you are already using SEO Ultimate, chances are you have already implemented these changes. If not, then let’s get started by making your website canonical and segmenting any potential duplicate content penalties.

If not, then let’s get started by making your website canonical and segmenting any potential duplicate content penalties. This is particularly important to new websites so they can make a great first impression (by preventing non-canonical taxonomies or duplicate content from being indexed).</p>\n<p>With Google constantly updating their algorithms (Penguin, Panda and the other zoo animals running amuck) you&#8217;ll need to avoid tripping any algorithmic filters.

Hence, we created two methods to limit this scenario.</p>\n<h3>Reeling in Autolinks</h3>\n<p>The first link governor is located in the <strong>quantity restrictions</strong> region of the <strong>content link settings</strong> tab of the Deeplink Juggernaut Module that allows you to limit the autolink functionality to one instance per page/post (or you can adjust the number of instances per page/post with this option), but what about the rest of the website and those other potential instances of the keyword / autolink?</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9196\" title=\"Link Quantity Restrictions Setting\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/quantity-restrictions.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"236\" /></p>\n<p>Globally, aside from limiting the number of times the keyword was used in the content, what could be done to limit over optimization with autolinking?</p>\n<p>This was why we originally implemented a <strong>link cap</strong> via the <strong>per link customization feature</strong> for SEO Ultimate (on versions 6.5  to version 7.5.7) which allowed you to cap the links (and prevent additional instances of autolinking for each keyword) with a quantity based limit i.e. 15 times, 25 times, etc.</p>\n<p>While this feature worked beautifully on the majority of websites, in some server environments the per link customization site cap feature was rather intensive and created problems due to memory allocation and the inability to turn up the memory within shared hosting environments. So, now the module has evolved and been rewritten using a distinctly different approach we called <em>link dampening</em>.</p>\n<p>The Link Dampening feature allows you dampen the number of total links for internal link quantities for keywords assigned in the content link settings module of SEO Ultimate.</p>\n<h3>How it Works</h3>\n<p>If the anchor text you specify occurs many times throughout your site’s content, you may wish to reduce the overall frequency with which the anchor text is hyperlinked. You can reduce the autolinking frequency by a percentage with the Dampener field. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>0% dampening will have no effect.</li>\n<li>50% dampening means the anchor text will be autolinked approximately half as often as it otherwise would be.</li>\n<li>90% dampening means the anchor text will be autolinked only 10% as often as it otherwise would be.</li>\n<li>100% dampening means the anchor text won’t be linked at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The <strong>“Dampener” </strong>column will only appear if you’ve enabled it under the <strong>“Content Link Settings”</strong> tab.</p>\n<p>To set the feature globally, navigate to the Deeplink Juggernaut content links setting tab and click the option [x] globally decrease autolinking frequency by <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">x%</span>, then, add your percentage for global link dampening (using the appropirate ratio above).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9197\" title=\"Global Link Dampening Setting\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/global-dampening.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"235\" /></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use the next checkbox down [x] Add a dampener column to the content links editor (which allows you to dampen links on a per link quantity basis).</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9198\" title=\"Per Link Dampener Setting\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/per-link-dampen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"38\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">After activation of this setting, you can dampen link percentages on a keyword / per link basis.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9205\" title=\"Content Editor Dampener Percentage\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Dampener-percentage.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"233\" /></p>\n<p>We hope you enjoy and implement this useful SEO feature.

By consolidating these features into modules (that we could simply toggle on or off and configure at will) allowed us to virtually dominate hundreds of markets for our clients (without having to painstakingly customize the code time and time again).<span id=\"more-9173\"></span></p>\n<h3>Why All the Secrecy with SEO Ultimate?</h3>\n<p>Many wondered &#8211; if SEO Ultimate is so awesome, then why not show us how to use this thing? Well, frankly,  if you weren&#8217;t a client, then we didn&#8217;t want to create unnecessary competition in our markets, especially from giving away our most cherished methods free of charge.</p>\n<p>We hope this explains the lack of documentation over the years <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/\">aside from version updates</a> where we briefly informed users about new features, but in all honesty, we kept <strong>the real power of SEO Ultimate</strong> close to the chest &#8211; until now. The time has come to provide detailed documentation of each module, why it&#8217;s important and of course, how to use it &#8211; courtesy of our lead developer <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/JohnLamansky/\">John Lamansky</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some half-baked SEO plugins, we poured over 15 years of real world advanced SEO principles into this plugin. Prior to releasing this tutorial, the argument of just how powerful SEO Ultimate vs. any other SEO plugin <strong><em>may</em></strong> have been in question.

By consolidating these features into modules (that we could simply toggle on or off and configure at will) allowed us to virtually dominate hundreds of markets for our clients (without having to painstakingly customize the code time and time again).<span id=\"more-9173\"></span></p>\n<h3>Why All the Secrecy with SEO Ultimate?</h3>\n<p>Many wondered &#8211; if SEO Ultimate is so awesome, then why not show us how to use this thing? Well, frankly,  if you weren&#8217;t a client, then we didn&#8217;t want to create unnecessary competition in our markets, especially from giving away our most cherished methods free of charge.</p>\n<p>We hope this explains the lack of documentation over the years <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/\">aside from version updates</a> where we briefly informed users about new features, but in all honesty, we kept <strong>the real power of SEO Ultimate</strong> close to the chest &#8211; until now. The time has come to provide detailed documentation of each module, why it&#8217;s important and of course, how to use it &#8211; courtesy of our lead developer <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/JohnLamansky/\">John Lamansky</a>.</p>\n<p>Unlike some half-baked SEO plugins, we poured over 15 years of real world advanced SEO principles into this plugin. Prior to releasing this tutorial, the argument of just how powerful SEO Ultimate vs. any other SEO plugin <strong><em>may</em></strong> have been in question.

After logging in, simply click the red button and then proceed to the browse / upload feature.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2012/10/a-new-tool-to-disavow-links.html\"

width=\"506\" height=\"267\" /></a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Next, simply select the link location file (a .txt file with the URL’s or domains in question) and upload it and that’s

file, allow Google ample time to re-crawl the links (<em>with Googlebot armed with the link abort list</em>) and monitor the SERPs for signs of <strong><em>Penguin symptom- like</em></strong> recovery.</p>\n<p>Google suggests not to disavow links from your own website, however aside from that, this is one way to get rid of pesky links which could be hurting your website in the SERPs (search engine result pages).</p>\n<p>Since you can’t control who links to you, this is a great way to unwind potential backlinks acquired from negative <a

some way as a result of bad <a href=\"http://www.seoengine.com/link-neighborhood.htm\">link neighborhoods</a>).</p>\n<p>Consider yourself debriefed and good luck on your mission: <strong>Project SERP

weak internal pages with minimal value) from their index,  second, the backlink witch hunt / <strong>Penguin update</strong> (designed to demote websites from ranking highly which have <em>off-topic</em> or inbound links from low quality websites) and now <strong>the EMD update</strong> (the <strong>exact match domain update</strong>) which demotes websites which have exact match domains from easily ranking for their core keywords.<span id=\"more-9145\"></span></p>\n<h2>What&#8217;s an EMD?</h2>\n<p>While most savvy <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo/\" title=\"SEO\">SEO</a>’s or online marketing  types understand the lingo, for those unfamiliar with the terminology,  exact match domains are websites such as babycribs.com which <em>in the past</em> would rank rather easily for the key phrase “baby cribs”.</p>\n<p>Exact match domains are typically highly sought from <strong>“Domaineers”</strong> (individuals who purchase, collect, monetize or sell domains) due to their ability to (1) rank highly in search engines with a fraction of the effort by the virtue of the domain name or (2) monetize those sites due to the commercial viability (since consumers easily commit the domain name to memory); that is, until <strong>the Google EMD update</strong>.</p>\n<p>Before this update, there was a glaring loophole in search engines (Google in particular) which allowed exact match domains to rank uncontested with minimal SEO (sometimes within days of being created). So, instead of spending money on SEO, backlinks or promotion, businesses would often spend the money on acquiring a top level exact match domain.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple, a website in the #1 position for an organic search phrase can garner 42-70% of the click through traffic for a keyword (compared to 2% in the number 10 position on the page); and since 7 out of 10 people typically click the organic results instead of paid (PPC) results, this is a major blow if dethroned from the #1 position or top 3 organic positions on the page.</p>\n<h2>Minor or Major Change?</h2>\n<p>On September 28<sup>th</sup>, avid SEO personality <a href=\"http://www.seroundtable.com/google-emd-update-15776.html\">Barry Schwartz</a> from <strong>SEO Round Table</strong> gleaned a tidbit of relevant info on the EMD update.

I’m sure Myspace, Digg and other once popular websites never saw it coming as they were displaced by a fickle (or bored) user base or lots of savvy emerging competitors who introduced something equally viable to woo their users away. The end result,  their traffic sources (repeat visitors) dried up (like dust in the wind).</p>\n<p>While search does not exclusively belong to Google, quality matters and the importance and credibility of organic results is what delivers the most traffic from repeat visitors.</p>\n<p>If the quality and relevancy suffers, the site loses its value. In my opinion, that is how I view Google’s search results, quite simply, <em>they have filtered so many things that good sites along with the bad have been suppressed </em>(which translates to a poor user experience). I find myself having to refine my searches more and more, since the results on the first page are NOT what I am looking for and often are so far off topic I am amazed how it surfaced.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Let Bad Search Happen to You!</h2>\n<p>So, not to go all <strong>“fist of goodness”</strong> on you here (props to direct TV vs. cable ads) but, this is one thing for both Google and users alike to keep in mind.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Lo2hyWYOV6g?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/Lo2hyWYOV6g?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>When people lose confidence in search engines, the less people search, the less people search, the less valuable the paid ads become, the less valuable the paid ads become the more a search engine tries to justify its position to those paying for ads, the more a search engine tries to justify its position for those paying for ads, the more changes, penalties or adjustments are enforced through “the index vs. the content in the index” which affects its organic user base, the more changes, penalties or adjustments are made that affect the organic user base, the less users will depend on search engines.</p>\n<p>Don’t let bad search happen to you, don’t rely strictly on search engines…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=ryL6RtTC0UA:Dr3friZCmoo:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/ryL6RtTC0UA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}s:11:\"description\";s:339:\"If you’re a webmaster and have been impacted (penalized, lost traffic or have been caught in an algorithmic filter) from Google, the conclusion is obvious that Google isn’t trying to win a popularity contests with their user base lately.

Otherwise, you may have to seek <a href=\"http://www.networkedblogs.com/\">alternative traffic sources</a> to offset dependency on Google’s organic traffic as a life vein for your business.</p>\n<h2>SEO Bizarro World</h2>\n<p>Is the epic battle of giants affecting your business?</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<div id=\"attachment_9150\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9150\" title=\"6a00d8345158e369e200e552abeda58834-500wi\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/6a00d8345158e369e200e552abeda58834-500wi.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"377\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Me Facebook Beat You Google</p></div>\n<p>Image courtesy of (<a href=\"http://comiccoverage.typepad.com/comic_coverage/2008/06/cover-to-cover-action-comics-1.html\">comic coverage</a>).</p>\n<p>In this Bizarro world where Google wants to be more social and Facebook is talking about creating their own search engine, <em>be worried, be very worried</em> since core competencies exist for a reason.</p>\n<p>The rise and fall of search results for webmasters may result in a requiem for search engines, since consumers can easily <strong>“jump ship”</strong> and find the next big thing and find new ways to <strong>get what they want</strong>.</p>\n<p>Let’s just say that backlash is an understatement and when the search bubble bursts (and it will), I wouldn’t want to be in aisle 5 (if you catch my drift). I’m sure Myspace, Digg and other once popular websites never saw it coming as they were displaced by a fickle (or bored) user base or lots of savvy emerging competitors who introduced something equally viable to woo their users away. The end result,  their traffic sources (repeat visitors) dried up (like dust in the wind).</p>\n<p>While search does not exclusively belong to Google, quality matters and the importance and credibility of organic results is what delivers the most traffic from repeat visitors.</p>\n<p>If the quality and relevancy suffers, the site loses its value. In my opinion, that is how I view Google’s search results, quite simply, <em>they have filtered so many things that good sites along with the bad have been suppressed </em>(which translates to a poor user experience). I find myself having to refine my searches more and more, since the results on the first page are NOT what I am looking for and often are so far off topic I am amazed how it surfaced.</p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t Let Bad Search Happen to You!</h2>\n<p>So, not to go all <strong>“fist of goodness”</strong> on you here (props to direct TV vs. cable ads) but, this is one thing for both Google and users alike to keep in mind.</p>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\"

your promotions</a> (content, images and links) and (c) in the social graph as hooks <strong>that all drive traffic back to your branded promotional properties</strong> or your <strong>primary website. </strong>Expanding this process systemically facilitates perpetual conversions.</p>\n<h3>Is SEO Dead As We Know It?</h3>\n<p>Have the rules changed? Absolutely! Is SEO dead? <em>In its previous embodiment</em>, to a large extent, yes!  So, the bottom line is (1) what now?

It’s not just about rankings; it’s about how scalable your traffic sources are and how adept you are in extracting <strong>relevant traffic on demand</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Spoiler Alert Regarding Blog Networks!!!</h3>\n<p>Do mixed-fruit blog networks still work? No! or at least until a filter weeds them out. However, <strong>theme relevant networks </strong>still pass ranking factor (and can serve as a branded broadcast beacon for extended promotions), which means a link  from <strong>site B</strong> to <strong>site A</strong> must be <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">theme relevant</a> (have the same topic) and use the appropriate anchor text along  with related synonyms (a.k.a. the DNA Braid) to avoid overoptimization filters or being smacked / deindexed.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a beacon/site, it also helps to create stellar content (worthy of social media) and syndicate that content (to build links to your links) and ensure the longevity of your <strong>&#8220;broadcast channel&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n<p>The new paradigm suggests to look past rankings and think of <strong>each site or promotional property</strong> as a beacon, broadcasting YOU (your brand), All the Time, Right NOW!</p>\n<h3>It’s Not About Links, It’s About Promotions!</h3>\n<p>In a competitive online environment, using obsolete legacy metrics (such as search engine rankings and only using one website to compete) is defunct as a viable strategy.</p>\n<p>The imperative <strong>metrics</strong> to consider are (1) how scalable are your personal broadcast networks? and (2) how theme relevant and extensive are your syndication sequences for generating <strong>traffic</strong> which is <em>the only metric that matters</em>.</p>\n<p>Learn <strong>how to create a proper promotional campaign</strong>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which keywords to use</li>\n<li>how much those keywords are worth to your business</li>\n<li>how long it will take to get ranked</li>\n<li>how to use website silo architecture  to build your website</li>\n<li>which content , synonyms and type of promotions you need to drive traffic</li>\n<li>knowing which social media sites, RSS directories, video sites or press release<br />\nsources to use and having a project management suite to coordinate your team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Take The Next Step: Watch the <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\">DWS 4.0</a> Webinar!</h3>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Sure, on page SEO is still important, however quality content and engagement is a metric you simply can’t afford to overlook, and about that “<em>off page SEO thing</em>”, yeah, <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/how-to-avoid-seo-over-optimization/\">over optimization</a> is real, but just keep in mind, now, it’s not just about links, it’s about promotions.</p>\n<p>Allow me to explain!</p>\n<p><strong>People Hemmed up in Panda and Penguin Algorithms Typically:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Got a bit too greedy with off page SEO (link metrics) and churned out as much content to build links as possible (without thinking of quality).As a result, Google struck back with their quality control algorithms which comprised stricter filters, classifiers and relevance signals, (i.e. social signals, engagement time, bounce rate, <em>thematic relevance of the link graph</em> for the target and refering site) and 200 other <strong>fancy smancy words</strong> that translate to <strong>“if your website sucks, then good luck finding it in their SERPs&#8221;</strong>).</li>\n<li>People hemmed up in the Panda / Penguin Algo had a tendency to get a bit too lose with quality control on their promotional content and found out that <strong>regardless of the traffic source</strong> – you <strong>MUST</strong> have something useful to contribute.Otherwise, your content will simply be skimmed over for something useful and ignored vs. starting with a solid foundation of engaging contnent and promotional content to begin with.</li>\n<li>Websites drastically afftected by Panda or Penguin often relied too heavily on one metric (such as links)  because it was working and thus became complacent in regard to seeking viable alternatives or finding new ways to reach their ideal consumer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, Google is merely one traffic source; a very popular one, but not  every consumer uses or purchases exclusively through their link/traffic/ sales funnel. This means, there are a myriad of <strong>alternate traffic funnels</strong> that you can leverage systematically to reach your audience contextually, socially or otherwise.</p>\n<p>A consumer’s impulse to purchase is either active or dormant, yet if that dormant spark of desire is enlivened through curiosity, a clever headline, utility or impulse, then conversion is merely a few clicks away. Conversions (making a sale) is not exclusive to Google, in fact, conversions can occur from a multitude of sources.</p>\n<p>For example, a conversion could occur from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>playing a game online and being lured by an enticing banner</li>\n<li>during social interactions on Facebook (or other social platforms) from banners or contextual links<br />\nbeing lured from teaser “check this out” social media content or images in their various clever iterations</li>\n<li>from reading articles and clicking the contextual links (after social proof is established).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process, setting up the sales funnel should not be left to happenstance alone. In fact, when we map this phase of a campaign for a new client, we use what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsS8Zppd_q4\">Russell Wright</a> brilliantly coined as the <strong>IS-DNA</strong>. The letter &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;IS-DNA&#8221; stands for Invention/Innovation/Industry and the &#8220;S&#8221; stands for &#8220;Solution&#8221;.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9124\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9124\" title=\"Network-Empire-DWS-DNA\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Network-Empire-DWS-DNA.jpg\" alt=\"Network-Empire-DWS-DNA\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Understanding Promotion as a Stackable Process</p></div>\n<p>When we speak of &#8220;DNA&#8221; in our material we simply mean &#8220;components of&#8221; or <strong>&#8220;building blocks of&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n<p>So &#8220;IS-DNA&#8221; translates into the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of your innovation or invention that you have provided to your industry.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the IS-DNA process is to align your market&#8217;s FAQs (frequently asked questions) with your market&#8217;s SAQ&#8217;s (should ask questions) by drilling down and getting to <strong>&#8220;the questions behind the questions&#8221;</strong>, or <strong>&#8220;the pain behind the questions</strong>&#8221; which will be used later to create highly converting articles and videos using the PAM (painkiller article method).</p>\n<p>Remember that we are giving you a <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\">highly profitable stack-able business process</a>, and the IS-DNA may very well be the most important part of the entire process, because it is the BASE of your PLMM (Perpetual Lead Magnet Machine) System and Pyramid. <strong>Get this wrong</strong> and you may end up <strong>using the wrong language to talk to the wrong market!</strong></p>\n<p>The IS-DNA set&#8217;s the stage by creating a matrix of market questions in order to help you select the most effective language that can reach your target market because you (and your team) will truly understand the problems and pains that have been solved for them by your product or service (innovation or invention).</p>\n<p>Once you have mapped out <strong>“the pain in the market”</strong>, you can tactfully craft “<a href=\"http://www.theme-zoom.com/krakken12/pdf/the-4-million-dollar-market-research-questions.pdf\">pain killers</a>” (PDF Download) in your content, videos, social media and/or promotions to transcend <em>traffic-dependency</em> (such as Google) to devour your entire market. To thrive, you’ll have to escape the grasp of one simple traffic funnel to flourish.</p>\n<p>Whenever you rely solely on a <strong>“<em>for profit business</em>”</strong>, <em>that business</em> (potentially) has the ability to <strong>endanger your bottom line</strong>. Just as the “<em>eggs in one basket</em>” adage comes to mind, the question is, are you still in Google’s pocket? Or have you considered a long-term contingent strategy diverse enough to flourish (if Google or your most lucrative traffic source simply stopped providing traffic?).</p>\n<p>To avoid putting your business at risk you must hedge your primary property with branded social media and third-party websites (just in case). Consider Google’s last algorithm change Penguin. Many who were unprepared suffered, as their once profitable websites spigot of traffic got shut off, <strong>forcing them to find alternatives</strong> &#8211; rather than diverisfying and being prepared (as if Google never existed) in the first place.</p>\n<p>In order to do that, you must change the way you think, which means instead of thinking about <strong>backlinks and on page optimization</strong>, replace on page SEO with “<em>genuinely engaging content</em>” and replace backlinks with the idea of “<em>broadcasts</em>” and “<em>promotions</em>” and broadcasting your brand (across hundreds of traffic-bearing sources) using a <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=www.networkempire.com/testimonials/\">stackable / repeatable process</a> that YOU control.</p>\n<p>Remember, backlinks are merely a byproduct of promotions if you don’t have anything worthy of sending traffic to, then visitors will simply bounce in search of better content; so, there is no need to put the cart before the horse.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9127\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/how-to-get-your-seo-call-to-action-and-conversion-on-the-same-page/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9127\" title=\"call-to-action\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/call-to-action.jpg\" alt=\"Call to Action\" width=\"400\" height=\"486\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Does Your Content Have a Clear Call to Action?</p></div>\n<p>After seeing the image above, did you want to buy something?

Content farms thrived, comment spam, forum links and network sites were the rave.</p>\n<p>The truth is, most SEO practioners missed the boat from taking short cuts with their primary and promotional content. The notion that people would actually consume or be persuaded by fodder (lackluster content) and purchase is ridiculous.

It’s not just about rankings; it’s about how scalable your traffic sources are and how adept you are in extracting <strong>relevant traffic on demand</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Spoiler Alert Regarding Blog Networks!!!</h3>\n<p>Do mixed-fruit blog networks still work? No! or at least until a filter weeds them out. However, <strong>theme relevant networks </strong>still pass ranking factor (and can serve as a branded broadcast beacon for extended promotions), which means a link  from <strong>site B</strong> to <strong>site A</strong> must be <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">theme relevant</a> (have the same topic) and use the appropriate anchor text along  with related synonyms (a.k.a. the DNA Braid) to avoid overoptimization filters or being smacked / deindexed.</p>\n<p>If you are creating a beacon/site, it also helps to create stellar content (worthy of social media) and syndicate that content (to build links to your links) and ensure the longevity of your <strong>&#8220;broadcast channel&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n<p>The new paradigm suggests to look past rankings and think of <strong>each site or promotional property</strong> as a beacon, broadcasting YOU (your brand), All the Time, Right NOW!</p>\n<h3>It’s Not About Links, It’s About Promotions!</h3>\n<p>In a competitive online environment, using obsolete legacy metrics (such as search engine rankings and only using one website to compete) is defunct as a viable strategy.</p>\n<p>The imperative <strong>metrics</strong> to consider are (1) how scalable are your personal broadcast networks? and (2) how theme relevant and extensive are your syndication sequences for generating <strong>traffic</strong> which is <em>the only metric that matters</em>.</p>\n<p>Learn <strong>how to create a proper promotional campaign</strong>, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>which keywords to use</li>\n<li>how much those keywords are worth to your business</li>\n<li>how long it will take to get ranked</li>\n<li>how to use website silo architecture  to build your website</li>\n<li>which content , synonyms and type of promotions you need to drive traffic</li>\n<li>knowing which social media sites, RSS directories, video sites or press release<br />\nsources to use and having a project management suite to coordinate your team.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Take The Next Step: Watch the <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\">DWS 4.0</a> Webinar!</h3>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/txB97iCsUmU?version=3&amp;hl=en_US\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Sure, on page SEO is still important, however quality content and engagement is a metric you simply can’t afford to overlook, and about that “<em>off page SEO thing</em>”, yeah, <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/how-to-avoid-seo-over-optimization/\">over optimization</a> is real, but just keep in mind, now, it’s not just about links, it’s about promotions.</p>\n<p>Allow me to explain!</p>\n<p><strong>People Hemmed up in Panda and Penguin Algorithms Typically:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Got a bit too greedy with off page SEO (link metrics) and churned out as much content to build links as possible (without thinking of quality).As a result, Google struck back with their quality control algorithms which comprised stricter filters, classifiers and relevance signals, (i.e. social signals, engagement time, bounce rate, <em>thematic relevance of the link graph</em> for the target and refering site) and 200 other <strong>fancy smancy words</strong> that translate to <strong>“if your website sucks, then good luck finding it in their SERPs&#8221;</strong>).</li>\n<li>People hemmed up in the Panda / Penguin Algo had a tendency to get a bit too lose with quality control on their promotional content and found out that <strong>regardless of the traffic source</strong> – you <strong>MUST</strong> have something useful to contribute.Otherwise, your content will simply be skimmed over for something useful and ignored vs. starting with a solid foundation of engaging contnent and promotional content to begin with.</li>\n<li>Websites drastically afftected by Panda or Penguin often relied too heavily on one metric (such as links)  because it was working and thus became complacent in regard to seeking viable alternatives or finding new ways to reach their ideal consumer.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Remember, Google is merely one traffic source; a very popular one, but not  every consumer uses or purchases exclusively through their link/traffic/ sales funnel. This means, there are a myriad of <strong>alternate traffic funnels</strong> that you can leverage systematically to reach your audience contextually, socially or otherwise.</p>\n<p>A consumer’s impulse to purchase is either active or dormant, yet if that dormant spark of desire is enlivened through curiosity, a clever headline, utility or impulse, then conversion is merely a few clicks away. Conversions (making a sale) is not exclusive to Google, in fact, conversions can occur from a multitude of sources.</p>\n<p>For example, a conversion could occur from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>playing a game online and being lured by an enticing banner</li>\n<li>during social interactions on Facebook (or other social platforms) from banners or contextual links<br />\nbeing lured from teaser “check this out” social media content or images in their various clever iterations</li>\n<li>from reading articles and clicking the contextual links (after social proof is established).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process, setting up the sales funnel should not be left to happenstance alone. In fact, when we map this phase of a campaign for a new client, we use what <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsS8Zppd_q4\">Russell Wright</a> brilliantly coined as the <strong>IS-DNA</strong>. The letter &#8220;I&#8221; in &#8220;IS-DNA&#8221; stands for Invention/Innovation/Industry and the &#8220;S&#8221; stands for &#8220;Solution&#8221;.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9124\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 510px\"><a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9124\" title=\"Network-Empire-DWS-DNA\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Network-Empire-DWS-DNA.jpg\" alt=\"Network-Empire-DWS-DNA\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Understanding Promotion as a Stackable Process</p></div>\n<p>When we speak of &#8220;DNA&#8221; in our material we simply mean &#8220;components of&#8221; or <strong>&#8220;building blocks of&#8221;</strong>.</p>\n<p>So &#8220;IS-DNA&#8221; translates into the &#8220;building blocks&#8221; of your innovation or invention that you have provided to your industry.</p>\n<p>The purpose of the IS-DNA process is to align your market&#8217;s FAQs (frequently asked questions) with your market&#8217;s SAQ&#8217;s (should ask questions) by drilling down and getting to <strong>&#8220;the questions behind the questions&#8221;</strong>, or <strong>&#8220;the pain behind the questions</strong>&#8221; which will be used later to create highly converting articles and videos using the PAM (painkiller article method).</p>\n<p>Remember that we are giving you a <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152\">highly profitable stack-able business process</a>, and the IS-DNA may very well be the most important part of the entire process, because it is the BASE of your PLMM (Perpetual Lead Magnet Machine) System and Pyramid. <strong>Get this wrong</strong> and you may end up <strong>using the wrong language to talk to the wrong market!</strong></p>\n<p>The IS-DNA set&#8217;s the stage by creating a matrix of market questions in order to help you select the most effective language that can reach your target market because you (and your team) will truly understand the problems and pains that have been solved for them by your product or service (innovation or invention).</p>\n<p>Once you have mapped out <strong>“the pain in the market”</strong>, you can tactfully craft “<a href=\"http://www.theme-zoom.com/krakken12/pdf/the-4-million-dollar-market-research-questions.pdf\">pain killers</a>” (PDF Download) in your content, videos, social media and/or promotions to transcend <em>traffic-dependency</em> (such as Google) to devour your entire market. To thrive, you’ll have to escape the grasp of one simple traffic funnel to flourish.</p>\n<p>Whenever you rely solely on a <strong>“<em>for profit business</em>”</strong>, <em>that business</em> (potentially) has the ability to <strong>endanger your bottom line</strong>. Just as the “<em>eggs in one basket</em>” adage comes to mind, the question is, are you still in Google’s pocket? Or have you considered a long-term contingent strategy diverse enough to flourish (if Google or your most lucrative traffic source simply stopped providing traffic?).</p>\n<p>To avoid putting your business at risk you must hedge your primary property with branded social media and third-party websites (just in case). Consider Google’s last algorithm change Penguin. Many who were unprepared suffered, as their once profitable websites spigot of traffic got shut off, <strong>forcing them to find alternatives</strong> &#8211; rather than diverisfying and being prepared (as if Google never existed) in the first place.</p>\n<p>In order to do that, you must change the way you think, which means instead of thinking about <strong>backlinks and on page optimization</strong>, replace on page SEO with “<em>genuinely engaging content</em>” and replace backlinks with the idea of “<em>broadcasts</em>” and “<em>promotions</em>” and broadcasting your brand (across hundreds of traffic-bearing sources) using a <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=www.networkempire.com/testimonials/\">stackable / repeatable process</a> that YOU control.</p>\n<p>Remember, backlinks are merely a byproduct of promotions if you don’t have anything worthy of sending traffic to, then visitors will simply bounce in search of better content; so, there is no need to put the cart before the horse.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9127\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/how-to-get-your-seo-call-to-action-and-conversion-on-the-same-page/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9127\" title=\"call-to-action\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/call-to-action.jpg\" alt=\"Call to Action\" width=\"400\" height=\"486\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Does Your Content Have a Clear Call to Action?</p></div>\n<p>After seeing the image above, did you want to buy something? Ok, perhaps not this time right? It&#8217;s obvious that the image/message and timing doesn&#8217;t coinside as a strong call to action.</p>\n<p>The point remains that regardless of the website a consumer is frequenting, conversion is merely a matter of enlivening synchronicity (between their needs and desires to your<strong> perfect solution</strong> via a product or service) to facilitate an impulse to purchase.</p>\n<p>This fact was often overlooked entirely from SEO practitioners prior to Penguin who focused solely on <em>fabricating lackluster content</em> and flinging it in a thousand directions in an attempt to get links. Content farms thrived, comment spam, forum links and network sites were the rave.</p>\n<p>The truth is, most SEO practioners missed the boat from taking short cuts with their primary and promotional content. The notion that people would actually consume or be persuaded by fodder (lackluster content) and purchase is ridiculous. Don’t make the same mistake…<strong>tap the web</strong>, not just Google as a source of revenue.</p>\n<h3>Why Has Our Blog Been So Quiet for 3 Months?</h3>\n<p>In case you have wondered why the 3 month silence on the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/\">SEO Design Solutions</a> Blog, On April 8th, I survived a horrific motorcycle crash avoiding a minivan that took my lane while I was riding my Ducati 996 at 90 MPH. It resulted in tumbling twisting and sliding nearly 900 feet on the Freeway (like a bowling ball). </p>\n<p>Although the bike is totalled, I have multiple broken bones and some bumps and bruises (which are all healing now), thankfully, I survived with no brain injury or spinal damage.</p>\n<p>However, during the last 90 days, we have continued to make updates to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-ultimate/\">SEO Ultimate</a> “<strong>The Real All-In One SEO Plugin</strong>” and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/sneak-peak-of-the-wp-ultimate-theme-by-seo-design-solutions%E2%84%A2/\">The WP Ultimate Theme</a> – our sleek, flexible, WordPress Theme Framework (designed to give existing WordPress frameworks a run for their money).</p>\n<p>Also, later this month our lead developer <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/JohnLamansky/\">John Lamansky</a> plans to release an updated video for all the SEO Ultimate features from version .5 to present (which includes dozens of tips, updates and tweaks).</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, we will release our beta version of WP Ultimate for suggestions and tweaks for the final version.

That dependency can be weaned and replaced if those same business owners took their searches or paid search budget to other viable search engines and / or traffic sources to funnel traffic.</p>\n<p>Objectively, it’s time to see things for what they really are; the fact that Google (not surprisingly) is a business model motivated by profits. Despite the <strong>“don’t be evil”</strong> motto which once brandished a blind eye from most, with recent allegations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google\">privacy concerns</a>, changes in Adwords policies (which left thousands banned <strong>with no explanation</strong>) and the constant organic search algorithm shuffle, at some point users will come to terms with this and act accordingly (and ignore Google).</p>\n<h3>The Pervasive Threat of Google Penalties</h3>\n<p>Recently Google informed untold numbers of webmasters that they were in <a href=\"http://next.inman.com/2012/04/google-evolves-are-you-ready/\">violation of their terms of service</a> for unnatural link activity. Needless to say, the fear of loss is a great motivator. When people are told to conform, most will to avoid going against the current of the status quo.</p>\n<p>However, the audacity that webmasters should conform to a terms of service (considering they didn&#8217;t opt in in the first place) based on Google&#8217;s limitation on determining the value of the link graph (paid link, intentional link, unintenional link, etc.) is preposterous. It&#8217;s not like anyone in their index ever received a request asking if it was ok to crawl your content and include it in their index?</p>\n<p>Does CNN, New York Times, USA today or other massive authority sites add rel=”nofollow” tags to every outbound link or risk getting deindexed? No, they do not… Then why should you have to?</p>\n<p>The fact is that websites with that extent of authority simply don’t need Google (because they already have an established brand) and users will go directly to their website instead of using Google as an intermediary (which is essentially all they are).</p>\n<p>And how <strong>“relevant”</strong> would Google be if a user typed in CNN in Google and couldn’t find CNN (or any large brand for that matter), which makes brands essentially immune to being banned from their search results.</p>\n<p>Yet, for small businesses, entrepreneurs, affiliates and others forced to compete daily in search engines to funnel traffic to thrive and survive are constantly pummeled by the vague terms of service which essentially means you cannot promote your website (unless it’s done according to Google’s promotional policy).</p>\n<h3>Google&#8217;s Stance on Links is Dated</h3>\n<p>Sorry, the last time I checked links were not exclusively designed to manipulate PageRank, <strong>links are just links</strong>, the are simply how people move <em>from page to page and website to website</em>.

That dependency can be weaned and replaced if those same business owners took their searches or paid search budget to other viable search engines and / or traffic sources to funnel traffic.</p>\n<p>Objectively, it’s time to see things for what they really are; the fact that Google (not surprisingly) is a business model motivated by profits. Despite the <strong>“don’t be evil”</strong> motto which once brandished a blind eye from most, with recent allegations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Google\">privacy concerns</a>, changes in Adwords policies (which left thousands banned <strong>with no explanation</strong>) and the constant organic search algorithm shuffle, at some point users will come to terms with this and act accordingly (and ignore Google).</p>\n<h3>The Pervasive Threat of Google Penalties</h3>\n<p>Recently Google informed untold numbers of webmasters that they were in <a href=\"http://next.inman.com/2012/04/google-evolves-are-you-ready/\">violation of their terms of service</a> for unnatural link activity. Needless to say, the fear of loss is a great motivator. When people are told to conform, most will to avoid going against the current of the status quo.</p>\n<p>However, the audacity that webmasters should conform to a terms of service (considering they didn&#8217;t opt in in the first place) based on Google&#8217;s limitation on determining the value of the link graph (paid link, intentional link, unintenional link, etc.) is preposterous. It&#8217;s not like anyone in their index ever received a request asking if it was ok to crawl your content and include it in their index?</p>\n<p>Does CNN, New York Times, USA today or other massive authority sites add rel=”nofollow” tags to every outbound link or risk getting deindexed? No, they do not… Then why should you have to?</p>\n<p>The fact is that websites with that extent of authority simply don’t need Google (because they already have an established brand) and users will go directly to their website instead of using Google as an intermediary (which is essentially all they are).</p>\n<p>And how <strong>“relevant”</strong> would Google be if a user typed in CNN in Google and couldn’t find CNN (or any large brand for that matter), which makes brands essentially immune to being banned from their search results.</p>\n<p>Yet, for small businesses, entrepreneurs, affiliates and others forced to compete daily in search engines to funnel traffic to thrive and survive are constantly pummeled by the vague terms of service which essentially means you cannot promote your website (unless it’s done according to Google’s promotional policy).</p>\n<h3>Google&#8217;s Stance on Links is Dated</h3>\n<p>Sorry, the last time I checked links were not exclusively designed to manipulate PageRank, <strong>links are just links</strong>, the are simply how people move <em>from page to page and website to website</em>.

The extent of the authority of a website, determines how long (or short) a keyword conquest becomes.</p>\n<p>If your website has exceeded the necessary tipping point (meaning it has enough <a href=\"http://www.miislita.com/information-retrieval-tutorial/cosine-similarity-tutorial.html\">term weight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seoengine.com/link-flow.htm\">link-flow</a> from supporting anchor text and pages) and nests the proper on page signals, then that website is a candidate for occupying the top 1000 seed pages in Google’s index otherwise dubbed &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-basics/seizing-the-seo-window-of-opportunity/\">the authority set</a>&#8220;. In essence, the more weight the pages have, the more pages from that domain can be included as seeds in the organic search landscape.</p>\n<p>While other pages are crawled, only the top 1000 matter and from those 1000 pages there are typically a handful of domains which are considered dominant within the scope of that topic.</p>\n<p>Those websites are considered <strong>“the authority set”</strong> and once any page from any website has reached the apex of a topic and breaches the authority set, it now becomes the model that Google and other search engines compare other pages to (to ascertain relevance, validity and rankings).</p>\n<p>Your objective is to (a) model your data (b) site architecture (c) internal linking structures (d) backlinks and (e) navigation schema to reinforce the topical scope of a page for (1) the primary phrase (2) parallel themes or categories (3) synonyms and sibling themes and (4) adjacent pages which could benefit from the link-flow or page level / theme /authority of that page.</p>\n<p>This in turn allows you to funnel PageRank, trust and authority to any area of your website with the ideal anchor text (at will) which makes your website less dependent on off-site linking structures to achieve <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/applied-seo-pivotal-seo-metrics/\">buoyant ranking</a> factor.</p>\n<p>For example, we have built websites using this technique and created PR5 sites from brand new domain (which achieved first page results in 30-45 days time for competitive keywords up to 7,500,000 competing pages using less than 50 backlinks off-site.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the 70+ of the 95 internal pages also sprouted page rank (PR3,PR4 and PR5) which in turn funneled that <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/seo-tips-to-transfer-latent-ranking-factors/\">ranking factor</a> to other select pages creating an unparalleled <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/the-seo-tipping-point/\">tipping point</a> like a tube Taurus folding in on itself) to propel even more rankings as a result, which leads to my next point.</p>\n<p>Rankings can be observed from two perspectives (similar to the haves and have nots) and while the ultimate goal or <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-tips-to-optimize-a-new-website/\">optimizing your website</a> stems from the desire to reach the top 3 spots (the traffic band) getting there is ultimately determined by how authoritative your page is and the website that supports it.</p>\n<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>\n<p>Every page of your website (if optimal) represents an opportunity to rank that page and dozens more when combined with <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-best-practices-getting-started/\">SEO best practices</a>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevant meta data (for every page).</li>\n<li>A mirrored keyword-rich <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-url-structure/\">URL structure</a> for the primary market and semantic focus of the page.</li>\n<li>Proper H1 use to reflect the primary keyword</li>\n<li>Sufficient inclusion of theme relevant keywords for the primary and secondary keyword shingles (groups of words).</li>\n<li>Awareness of link-flow limitations (not having 100+links on a page via navigation and contextual areas to bleed ranking factor).</li>\n<li>Use of optimal internal linking</li>\n<li>Proper site architecture that reflects a <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/website-silo-architecture-seo-siloing-simplified/\">natural data hierarchy</a> (with more competitive keywords higher up in the hierarchy and less competitive categories and mid-tail and long-tail keyword variations supporting the theme).</li>\n<li>Proper grammar and conversion cues</li>\n<li>The proper proportion of themed inbound links from qualified sources to the home page and deep links to various supporting categories and landing pages (with their primary shingles and / or synonyms).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The takeaway here is, cultivation of authority is the goal of SEO.

The extent of the authority of a website, determines how long (or short) a keyword conquest becomes.</p>\n<p>If your website has exceeded the necessary tipping point (meaning it has enough <a href=\"http://www.miislita.com/information-retrieval-tutorial/cosine-similarity-tutorial.html\">term weight</a>, <a href=\"http://www.seoengine.com/link-flow.htm\">link-flow</a> from supporting anchor text and pages) and nests the proper on page signals, then that website is a candidate for occupying the top 1000 seed pages in Google’s index otherwise dubbed &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-basics/seizing-the-seo-window-of-opportunity/\">the authority set</a>&#8220;. In essence, the more weight the pages have, the more pages from that domain can be included as seeds in the organic search landscape.</p>\n<p>While other pages are crawled, only the top 1000 matter and from those 1000 pages there are typically a handful of domains which are considered dominant within the scope of that topic.</p>\n<p>Those websites are considered <strong>“the authority set”</strong> and once any page from any website has reached the apex of a topic and breaches the authority set, it now becomes the model that Google and other search engines compare other pages to (to ascertain relevance, validity and rankings).</p>\n<p>Your objective is to (a) model your data (b) site architecture (c) internal linking structures (d) backlinks and (e) navigation schema to reinforce the topical scope of a page for (1) the primary phrase (2) parallel themes or categories (3) synonyms and sibling themes and (4) adjacent pages which could benefit from the link-flow or page level / theme /authority of that page.</p>\n<p>This in turn allows you to funnel PageRank, trust and authority to any area of your website with the ideal anchor text (at will) which makes your website less dependent on off-site linking structures to achieve <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/applied-seo-pivotal-seo-metrics/\">buoyant ranking</a> factor.</p>\n<p>For example, we have built websites using this technique and created PR5 sites from brand new domain (which achieved first page results in 30-45 days time for competitive keywords up to 7,500,000 competing pages using less than 50 backlinks off-site.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the 70+ of the 95 internal pages also sprouted page rank (PR3,PR4 and PR5) which in turn funneled that <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/seo-tips-to-transfer-latent-ranking-factors/\">ranking factor</a> to other select pages creating an unparalleled <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/the-seo-tipping-point/\">tipping point</a> like a tube Taurus folding in on itself) to propel even more rankings as a result, which leads to my next point.</p>\n<p>Rankings can be observed from two perspectives (similar to the haves and have nots) and while the ultimate goal or <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-tips-to-optimize-a-new-website/\">optimizing your website</a> stems from the desire to reach the top 3 spots (the traffic band) getting there is ultimately determined by how authoritative your page is and the website that supports it.</p>\n<p>Allow me to elaborate.</p>\n<p>Every page of your website (if optimal) represents an opportunity to rank that page and dozens more when combined with <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-best-practices-getting-started/\">SEO best practices</a>, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevant meta data (for every page).</li>\n<li>A mirrored keyword-rich <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-url-structure/\">URL structure</a> for the primary market and semantic focus of the page.</li>\n<li>Proper H1 use to reflect the primary keyword</li>\n<li>Sufficient inclusion of theme relevant keywords for the primary and secondary keyword shingles (groups of words).</li>\n<li>Awareness of link-flow limitations (not having 100+links on a page via navigation and contextual areas to bleed ranking factor).</li>\n<li>Use of optimal internal linking</li>\n<li>Proper site architecture that reflects a <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/website-silo-architecture-seo-siloing-simplified/\">natural data hierarchy</a> (with more competitive keywords higher up in the hierarchy and less competitive categories and mid-tail and long-tail keyword variations supporting the theme).</li>\n<li>Proper grammar and conversion cues</li>\n<li>The proper proportion of themed inbound links from qualified sources to the home page and deep links to various supporting categories and landing pages (with their primary shingles and / or synonyms).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The takeaway here is, cultivation of authority is the goal of SEO. Once that authority has been realized, it must be leveraged to propel entire clusters of keywords into a prominent search engine position (with minimal backlinks) from using the overlapping nodes of relevance and page level trust and relevance score it has accumulated.</p>\n<p>The extent of the authority depends on (a) the freshness and introduction of new / <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-theme-and-silo-your-wordpress-blog/\">supporting content</a> (b) the volume of content (c) the age of the domain (d) the relevancy or the internal link structure and most importantly (e) the time to authority factor (like a fine wine aging over time) that represents the priceless / more elusive ranking factor to distill in reverse or from the perspective of a competitor to emulate.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=xSnyEisWj14:BvmIoZiDFbA:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/xSnyEisWj14\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}i:16;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:49:\"Website Silo Architecture: SEO Siloing Simplified\";s:4:\"link\";s:77:\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/zVJma9RiWtY/\";s:8:\"category\";s:13:\"SEO Resources\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:13:\"Jeffrey_Smith\";}s:7:\"pubdate\";s:29:\"Fri, 20 Jan 2012 15:27:02 PST\";s:4:\"guid\";s:102:\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/website-silo-architecture-seo-siloing-simplified/\";s:7:\"content\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";s:13262:\"<p>To draw on a visual analogy, most websites are like the image of mixed  fruit below (which makes it difficult for a search engine to determine  the topicality or relevance of the website (or more importantly the  page) when trying to determine what to rank that page for or why.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9094\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 293px\"><a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/website-silo-architecture-seo-siloing-simplified/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9094\" title=\"mixed-fruit\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/mixed-fruit.jpg\" alt=\"Mixed Fruit\" width=\"283\" height=\"424\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Most Websites Are Structured Like The Image Above</p></div>\n<p>Website silo architecture is the process of implementing a structure whereby each topic is housed in it&#8217;s own mini-site within the site and the internal linking pushes ranking factor back up to the primary / topic page otherwise dubbed the &#8220;silo landing page&#8221;.</p>\n<p>While SEO is simpler than most so called &#8220;experts&#8221; imply, it&#8217;s like the difference between a short order cook and a chef, they both cook food and often use the same ingredients, but it’s how they use them that matters.<span id=\"more-9096\"></span></p>\n<p>Similarly, when you dial in the appropriate on page and off page SEO using website silo architecture, then regardless of whether your website is aged or new, a website which previously had zero presence can instantly sprout wings and start ascending the SERPs (search engine result pages) to the top 5 results.</p>\n<p>On the contrary, if your execution lacks the proper structure for the granular ingredients, then lackluster results are sure to follow.

Here’s our take on five fundamental methods which we have deemed evergreen SEO principles we’ve used for years to create proven results.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Proper Title and URL structure.</li>\n<li>Proper H1 Use (to mirror title and URL).</li>\n<li>Proper site structure (cascading tiers of relevance).</li>\n<li>Theme relevant internal linking.</li>\n<li>The proper amount of link flow (to reach and exceed the tipping point).</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Proper Title and URL Structure</h3>\n<p>By using specific shingles (groups of words) in the title (with prominent keywords first) you send the strongest SEO signal to search engines (as they attempt to determine the topic of your page).</p>\n<p>The more diffused (or verbose) a title is, the less effective it is for SEO. For example, if I am trying to rank for <strong>insurance rates</strong>, then those shingles should be the sole or primary page title as well as the URL structure should follow suit such as domain.com/insurance-rates/</p>\n<p>While conversion cues must be balanced with SEO, it is possible to get the best of both worlds through using synonyms or plural variations in the title while keeping it succinct and relevant.</p>\n<p>For example, a title such as -  Insurance Rates: Find the Best Rate and Affordable Prices! (<strong>which also includes keywords like best, prices, rate and rates</strong>) in case consumers use a long-tail query, then your landing page can rank for all potential variations of any of the shingles.</p>\n<h3>Proper H1 Usage</h3>\n<p>Using the proper H1 tag (header tag) is a common tried and true SEO technique; if you use <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-theme-and-silo-your-wordpress-blog/\">WordPress</a> then your permalink (page title) can easily be switched to your H1 tag by simply changing your style sheet.</p>\n<p>If you are using other CMS (<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/creating-hybrid-staging-areas-for-legacy-cms-and-non-seo-friendly-crm-platforms/\">content management systems</a>) or static html pages, similarly, the suggestion to mirror your title and URL structure with the primary keyword is ideal. Such as the example above, the H1 tag should be <strong>“Insurance Rates”</strong>.</p>\n<p>One little trick is, you can also make the H1 (Header Tag / Text) a link and link that either to the home page or pass that ranking factor on to another page you intend to rank. If you are properly theming your website using website silo architecture, then it is possible to feed the primary silo landing page from your category pages this way (to page rank flows up and back to the primary landing page) from nested pages that support the category.</p>\n<h3>Proper Site Structure</h3>\n<p>Think of your website in tiers, those tier represent the natural data hierarchy of your website. Starting with your home page (in the root folder), this is tier 1 and the starting point for your SEO.</p>\n<p>The root folder is the natural destination for your most prominent pages and should house your primary landing pages in the first tier. This is because eventually, all the nested pages will pass their link-flow back to the root and you can scale laterally with multiple silo landing pages for competitive keywords and markets.</p>\n<p>Here is a visual aid to assist provided by <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">Network Empire</a>.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9095\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 325px\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9095\" title=\"sample-silo\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/sample-silo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"315\" height=\"369\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sample of Properly Siloed Website</p></div>\n<p>Using the example from above, domain.com/insurance-rates  – would be my Silo Landing Page, i.e. the keyword I want to rank for. Now, by adding relevant categories and supporting articles, you can give any landing /silo page wings in the SERPs (search engine result pages).</p>\n<h3>Theme-Relevant Internal Linking</h3>\n<p>To implement theme-relevant internal linking, It is linked from my homepage with the keyword “insurance rates” as the anchor text to reinforce it. I would also use contextual anchor text links to any other silo landing pages that need tier one link flow to support them.</p>\n<p>By writing a contextual article and linking to the silo landing pages from the homepage, any link juice my homepage receives, get ring-fenced and passed along to the on page editorial links (the silo landing pages / preferred keyword landing pages) by design.</p>\n<p>The next tier is your category pages; these will become the hub page that sites on tier 2 one folder away from the root.</p>\n<p>The category page and primary landing page share a similar URL structure, but the primary landing page is the grandparent and the category parent, next up the posts or supporting articles are the children of the parent/category page.</p>\n<p>For example (to support my silo landing page, I would create a category called <strong>“affordable insurance rates”</strong> since it is thematically relevant to the silo landing page.</p>\n<p>On that page, if I wanted to use the H1 tag to link back to the primary landing page with <strong>“insurance rates”</strong> it would pass along that link flow, when I add the tier 3 pages (blog posts/products or articles) depending on the type of site you are building.</p>\n<p>Domain.com/insurance-rates/affordable-insurance-rates/ &#8211; whereby the silo landing page becomes the grandparent, the category the parent and the post/supporting article becomes the child.</p>\n<p>The third tier would be used for adding supporting content under the nested <strong>theme relevant category</strong> which has the primary purpose of acting as a controlled portion of the website to administer all content that contains the primary or secondary keywords associated with the primary silo landing page.</p>\n<h3>Adding the Proper Amount of Link-Flow</h3>\n<p>Link flow is created from linking from page to page with the appropriate anchor text. <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">Link-flow</a> also takes the number of inbound and outbound links in addition to the strength and thematic relevance of the links. Siloing passes maximum link flow by capping contextual links (from only linking within the silo) and each page is linked via navigation by virtue of the category.</p>\n<p>As an example, if I added supporting articles to the affordable insurance rates category they would also be theme related and contain a contextual link that linked back to my category page, which in turn links to my silo landing page (primary landing page in the root).</p>\n<p>I would add pages like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best insurance rates</li>\n<li>Save money on insurance</li>\n<li>Compare insurance rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And each would become a post attached to the category, such as: domain.com/insurance-rates/affordable-insurance-rates/compare-insurance-rates</p>\n<p>And have navigational links to everything in that category, while linking back to the silo landing page with the contextual keyword it is trying to rank for “insurance rates”.</p>\n<p>The benefit to this type of siloing (using a helix link structure for the data hierarchy) is that the primary keyword (the most competitive phrase) gets ranked from the pooling link flow becoming buoyant underneath it and the category and supporting articles also get ranked as a side benefit (from the internal linking from the navigation).</p>\n<p>To take this a step further, you can mix the anchor text shingles and link back to the category / or silo landing page with multiple anchors (to create keyword stemming).</p>\n<p>Or, if you wanted to purely silo the page, then you would link in your navigation from the tier 3 pages back to your category page and use the contextual links from the nested supporting articles to link to the primary silo landing page (and not link across to other silos or silo landing pages from any category) only the parent or grandparent (Silo Landing Page).</p>\n<p>Building sites in this method produce tectonic shifts in rankings, the only thing you need to is (a) continue to drip fresh content and (b) start <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo-link-building.html\" title=\"Link Building\">link building</a> using deep links to the silo landing page or the category pages.</p>\n<p>There is no need to link to the supporting articles, unless you want to give them a boost, since, over time, they too will rank (from sharing the collective PageRank and link-flow of the theme cluster you created).</p>\n<h3>Website Silo Architecture SEO Tools Under Development</h3>\n<p>Siloing can be difficult, which is why to make this simple, this feature has been integrated into our upcoming theme WP Ultimate (which is still undergoing fine tuning). We will however, be releasing our plugin the WP Silo Importer that works in tandem with <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">Domain Web Studio</a> and allows you to build theme relevant optimized <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"WordPress SEO\">WordPress</a> sites in minutes (instead of painstakingly publishing dozens or hundreds of pages by hand).</p>\n<p>In order to use the advanced silo importer, you will require a subscription to DWS. But we also have a basic silo importer inside <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/sneak-peak-of-the-wp-ultimate-theme-by-seo-design-solutions%E2%84%A2/\">The WP Ultimate Theme</a>&#8220;</strong> that allows you to quickly and easily create categories and nested posts on the fly.</p>\n<p>The advanced silo importer however is far superior and adds a parent silo landing page, ties the category (using a page not a post) to keep link flow buoyant (so your rankings stick) and then uses the posts as the last tier after the categories.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WP Silo Importer Plugin</strong> (released within 7-10 days to the DWS community) also uses shortcode which you can inject into pages or sidebars to instantly build our all of the navigational elements for theming your content. Doing this by hand on a 100 page site would take hours, with our plugin, merely seconds.</p>\n<p>So, the takeaway is, proper planning from theming the website at the beginning of a campaign, combined with tactful supporting content and site structure can save you months on the way to page one and allow you to rank for multiple keywords with 1/10th of the links as a mixed-fruit website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=zVJma9RiWtY:H1qJvDoL1eg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/zVJma9RiWtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}s:11:\"description\";s:314:\"To draw on a visual analogy, most websites are like the image of mixed fruit below (which makes it difficult for a search engine to determine the topicality or relevance of the website (or more importantly the page) when trying to determine what to rank that page for or why.

Now, by adding relevant categories and supporting articles, you can give any landing /silo page wings in the SERPs (search engine result pages).</p>\n<h3>Theme-Relevant Internal Linking</h3>\n<p>To implement theme-relevant internal linking, It is linked from my homepage with the keyword “insurance rates” as the anchor text to reinforce it. I would also use contextual anchor text links to any other silo landing pages that need tier one link flow to support them.</p>\n<p>By writing a contextual article and linking to the silo landing pages from the homepage, any link juice my homepage receives, get ring-fenced and passed along to the on page editorial links (the silo landing pages / preferred keyword landing pages) by design.</p>\n<p>The next tier is your category pages; these will become the hub page that sites on tier 2 one folder away from the root.</p>\n<p>The category page and primary landing page share a similar URL structure, but the primary landing page is the grandparent and the category parent, next up the posts or supporting articles are the children of the parent/category page.</p>\n<p>For example (to support my silo landing page, I would create a category called <strong>“affordable insurance rates”</strong> since it is thematically relevant to the silo landing page.</p>\n<p>On that page, if I wanted to use the H1 tag to link back to the primary landing page with <strong>“insurance rates”</strong> it would pass along that link flow, when I add the tier 3 pages (blog posts/products or articles) depending on the type of site you are building.</p>\n<p>Domain.com/insurance-rates/affordable-insurance-rates/ &#8211; whereby the silo landing page becomes the grandparent, the category the parent and the post/supporting article becomes the child.</p>\n<p>The third tier would be used for adding supporting content under the nested <strong>theme relevant category</strong> which has the primary purpose of acting as a controlled portion of the website to administer all content that contains the primary or secondary keywords associated with the primary silo landing page.</p>\n<h3>Adding the Proper Amount of Link-Flow</h3>\n<p>Link flow is created from linking from page to page with the appropriate anchor text. <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">Link-flow</a> also takes the number of inbound and outbound links in addition to the strength and thematic relevance of the links. Siloing passes maximum link flow by capping contextual links (from only linking within the silo) and each page is linked via navigation by virtue of the category.</p>\n<p>As an example, if I added supporting articles to the affordable insurance rates category they would also be theme related and contain a contextual link that linked back to my category page, which in turn links to my silo landing page (primary landing page in the root).</p>\n<p>I would add pages like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best insurance rates</li>\n<li>Save money on insurance</li>\n<li>Compare insurance rates</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And each would become a post attached to the category, such as: domain.com/insurance-rates/affordable-insurance-rates/compare-insurance-rates</p>\n<p>And have navigational links to everything in that category, while linking back to the silo landing page with the contextual keyword it is trying to rank for “insurance rates”.</p>\n<p>The benefit to this type of siloing (using a helix link structure for the data hierarchy) is that the primary keyword (the most competitive phrase) gets ranked from the pooling link flow becoming buoyant underneath it and the category and supporting articles also get ranked as a side benefit (from the internal linking from the navigation).</p>\n<p>To take this a step further, you can mix the anchor text shingles and link back to the category / or silo landing page with multiple anchors (to create keyword stemming).</p>\n<p>Or, if you wanted to purely silo the page, then you would link in your navigation from the tier 3 pages back to your category page and use the contextual links from the nested supporting articles to link to the primary silo landing page (and not link across to other silos or silo landing pages from any category) only the parent or grandparent (Silo Landing Page).</p>\n<p>Building sites in this method produce tectonic shifts in rankings, the only thing you need to is (a) continue to drip fresh content and (b) start <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo-link-building.html\" title=\"Link Building\">link building</a> using deep links to the silo landing page or the category pages.</p>\n<p>There is no need to link to the supporting articles, unless you want to give them a boost, since, over time, they too will rank (from sharing the collective PageRank and link-flow of the theme cluster you created).</p>\n<h3>Website Silo Architecture SEO Tools Under Development</h3>\n<p>Siloing can be difficult, which is why to make this simple, this feature has been integrated into our upcoming theme WP Ultimate (which is still undergoing fine tuning). We will however, be releasing our plugin the WP Silo Importer that works in tandem with <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">Domain Web Studio</a> and allows you to build theme relevant optimized <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"WordPress SEO\">WordPress</a> sites in minutes (instead of painstakingly publishing dozens or hundreds of pages by hand).</p>\n<p>In order to use the advanced silo importer, you will require a subscription to DWS. But we also have a basic silo importer inside <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wordpress-seo/sneak-peak-of-the-wp-ultimate-theme-by-seo-design-solutions%E2%84%A2/\">The WP Ultimate Theme</a>&#8220;</strong> that allows you to quickly and easily create categories and nested posts on the fly.</p>\n<p>The advanced silo importer however is far superior and adds a parent silo landing page, ties the category (using a page not a post) to keep link flow buoyant (so your rankings stick) and then uses the posts as the last tier after the categories.</p>\n<p>The <strong>WP Silo Importer Plugin</strong> (released within 7-10 days to the DWS community) also uses shortcode which you can inject into pages or sidebars to instantly build our all of the navigational elements for theming your content. Doing this by hand on a 100 page site would take hours, with our plugin, merely seconds.</p>\n<p>So, the takeaway is, proper planning from theming the website at the beginning of a campaign, combined with tactful supporting content and site structure can save you months on the way to page one and allow you to rank for multiple keywords with 1/10th of the links as a mixed-fruit website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=zVJma9RiWtY:H1qJvDoL1eg:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/zVJma9RiWtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}i:17;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:37:\"3 SEO Tools to Crush Your Competition\";s:4:\"link\";s:77:\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/5QuEJFZhVcg/\";s:8:\"category\";s:65:\"SEO ToolsDomain Web StudioDWSNetwork EmpireSEO Project Management\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:13:\"Jeffrey_Smith\";}s:7:\"pubdate\";s:29:\"Tue, 10 Jan 2012 12:36:12 PST\";s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/?p=9084\";s:7:\"content\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";s:14834:\"<p>Our friends at Themezoom/Network Empire have an exclusive, <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\"> limited-time offer</a> allowing you to access exclusive tools like the Krakken, The  Last Keyword Tool and Domain Web Studio (DWS) at a significant savings off normally published prices.</p>\n<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9085\" title=\"3-seo-tools\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/3-seo-tools.jpg\" alt=\"3 SEO Tools\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\" /></a>\n<p>Whether you are an agency (who has clients), an affiliate (looking to leverage your assets for maximum ROI) or a small business owner (trying to carve you own slice of  a market), these tools represent the pinnacle  of market research, SEO implementation and  syndication, allowing you to  create an unfair advantage over your  competition.<span id=\"more-9084\"></span></p>\n<p>There are 3 videos below (each is over 1 hour) and shows you how to unleash the power of DWS (using data from the Krakken and Last Keyword Tool).  Consider them your training videos (after you <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">sign up</a>) and you can watch the layers unfold.

No matter what strategy you implement (with those 3 men) their limited scope and resources will fall short when <strong>the numbers game</strong> creeps into the equation.</p>\n<p>For a website to knock an authority site off the pedestal of the #1 position, it needs both (1) a foundation that is broad enough to support the ascent (by leveraging semantically structured supporting content) and (2) enough vertical milestones (categories and landing pages) to reach the apex for the primary phrase. This means for competitive markets, you may require thousands of pages (to support the mid tail and lucrative / competitive keywords) and dozens to hundreds of links to critical internal pages to reach the aggregate tipping point to reach the apex of a market.</p>\n<p>But also keep in mind, that for every primary keyword, there are dozens of mid-tail and long-tail keywords that are equally as lucrative (if you devour the entire market along the way).</p>\n<h3>The Project Management Module</h3>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QiSJJP4WiAY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QiSJJP4WiAY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>To create websites and manage the process (using clusters and co-occurrence), you need a scalable system that allows you to (a) identify keyword and markets (b) model data, cost, time management and resources and calculate ROI from <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/the-psychology-of-a-click-through-understanding-intention-fulfillment-and-desire/\">click through rates</a>, time to rank, the volume of content and internal links required per keyword or the number of deep links you will need (<em>that was our proprietary algorithm and you can see it work in Video 1 on the silo framework module above</em>) &#8211;

To accomplish this feat, you need a solid strategy and system based repeatability that targets entire cluster of phrases, (The DNA Braid) vs. a few poultry keywords.</p>\n<h3>The DNA Braid Module</h3>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UU61MNyQKvw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/UU61MNyQKvw?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>Would you rather rank for one keyword or rank for hundreds to thousands of keywords, that allow you to reach that “one” keyword faster while you enjoy the fruit of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/seo-rankings-and-how-to-create-them/\">keyword stemming</a> (ranking for stemmed variations) along the way?</p>\n<p>Time is the real asset in SEO and the extent of the volume of work you can accomplish depends on the tools you have at your disposal, and the team that you have to implement those tactics; especially when it comes to SEO and competing in saturated markets.</p>\n<p>To use an analogy, working with the wrong tools (against a seasoned competitor) is like bringing 3 men to a battle when your adversary has an army. No matter what strategy you implement (with those 3 men) their limited scope and resources will fall short when <strong>the numbers game</strong> creeps into the equation.</p>\n<p>For a website to knock an authority site off the pedestal of the #1 position, it needs both (1) a foundation that is broad enough to support the ascent (by leveraging semantically structured supporting content) and (2) enough vertical milestones (categories and landing pages) to reach the apex for the primary phrase. This means for competitive markets, you may require thousands of pages (to support the mid tail and lucrative / competitive keywords) and dozens to hundreds of links to critical internal pages to reach the aggregate tipping point to reach the apex of a market.</p>\n<p>But also keep in mind, that for every primary keyword, there are dozens of mid-tail and long-tail keywords that are equally as lucrative (if you devour the entire market along the way).</p>\n<h3>The Project Management Module</h3>\n<p><object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QiSJJP4WiAY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/QiSJJP4WiAY?version=3&amp;hl=en_US&amp;rel=0\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></embed></object></p>\n<p>To create websites and manage the process (using clusters and co-occurrence), you need a scalable system that allows you to (a) identify keyword and markets (b) model data, cost, time management and resources and calculate ROI from <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/the-psychology-of-a-click-through-understanding-intention-fulfillment-and-desire/\">click through rates</a>, time to rank, the volume of content and internal links required per keyword or the number of deep links you will need (<em>that was our proprietary algorithm and you can see it work in Video 1 on the silo framework module above</em>) &#8211; that is the power of DWS, Krakken and The Last Keyword Tool; that is the collective suite known as <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">Network Empire</a>.</p>\n<p>The volume and extent of the work you execute depends on the system and tools you have at your disposal, especially when SEO and competitive saturated markets are the battleground.</p>\n<p>Working with advanced SEO tools allows you to plan your roll-out with more depth, a more robust array of theme relevant supporting articles, categories and landing pages and allows you to work smarter and not harder when chipping away at market defining phrases.</p>\n<p>I have had the distinct honor of working with some of the most brilliant minds (the team from Themezoom) over the past 5 years and I can assure you that there are only a handful of people who understand and implement SEO on this level.</p>\n<p>While this was our best kept secret for years <strong>“The Krakken”</strong>, now it is time to borrow a phrase from Hades from Clash of the Titans and <strong>“Release the Krakken”!</strong></p>\n<p>This suite will allow you to walk into a market cold and within 20 minutes have the creamy keywords that float to the top in which to base your existing legacy site (by breathing life into it with a new blog) or start anew and scale the market in a fraction of the time.</p>\n<p>If you are struggling to find theme relevant keywords (based on sophisticated information retrieval algorithms such as sparse matrix clustering, co-occurrence, Bayes, PaIR, LSI and semantic connectivity) then the Krakken (which drills into 60-90,000 keywords in under 5 minutes) only brings you back phrases which are (1) theme relevant to the parent cluster (original keyword) and (2) either have organic search value or PPC search value.</p>\n<p>When you continue to refine, add synonyms and keep drilling, you end up with the perfect blueprint (like a skeleton) in which to build out your website into a robust authority site or niche specific entity.</p>\n<p>This means that if you include these phrases (in their respective website silo architecture) then the entire cluster gets devoured and you rank for more keywords with fewer inbound links (since your own website becomes its own PageRank and link-flow spewing, top 10 ranking juggernaut).</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that the Krakken transcends ordinary keyword research and uses the same type of natural data hierarchy information retrieval structures (such as Google, Yahoo and Bing) use to ascertain relevance.</p>\n<p>In short, a blueprint from the Krakken is like mirroring the ideal on page SEO elements, synonyms and synonymic sets search engines grade relevance score with as a conditional metric when analyzing authoritative websites and sorting the wheat from the chaff for positioning.</p>\n<p>Rarely would I share the exact tools we use to inspect, enter and  dominate markets, but in the spirit of the New Year I do have one  special offer I have been permitted to pass along (for a very limited  time) to all of you who either get our email / blog posts, read  whitepapers and updates from our plugin SEO Ultimate or know who we are  and what we do.</p>\n<p>In this special offer you get the opportunity to (1) unleash the Krakken in your market (2) it’s powerful and quite formidable little brother “The Last Keyword Tool” and (3) the DWS (Domain Web Studio) the most powerful SEO management suite ever conceived for:</p>\n<p><strong>a)</strong> mapping out markets</p>\n<p><strong>b)</strong> creating properly themed websites with silo site architecture</p>\n<p><strong>c)</strong> managing all elements of the campaign from outsourcing content creation, project management, web development and SEO tasks and most importantly</p>\n<p><strong>d)</strong> having a syndication blueprint that creates a timeline for every keyword, assesses its cost, time to rank, ROI and even lets you know how to cross the tipping-point with every keyword in a blueprint.</p>\n<p>Put simply, this bundle is a must! We have paid $12,000 a year just to use the Krakken, in this offer, you will have to <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">click and see for yourself</a> the savings you can receive.</p>\n<p>Do yourself a favor; you can win the battle before you even step on the field. I speak from experience on this one, we can do more in less time and completely crush seasoned competitors (such as brands, Wikipedia results, Amazon, Target, Wal-mart and other “strong sites”) using the formula’s developed from building sites (and links) in tandem with a search engines natural data hierarchy – and that is what you will learn from using this suite .</p>\n<p>In essence, Network Empire silently slays competitors and uses unstoppable algorithms (that search engines love and reward), and now, for a limited time you can save hundreds by <a href=\"http://www.networkempire.com/dap/a/?a=152&amp;p=http://www.networkempire.com/bundle-offers/\">following this link</a> and getting your subscription for a hefty discount.</p>\n<p>In closing, for those naysayers, here are links to an exclusive webinar on the DWS 3.5 launch and other videos on the Krakken and The Last Keyword Tool.</p>\n<p>This is not a marketing ploy; this is a special offer with bona fide savings for those of you who are serious about dominating your market. This offer will not last and will be pulled in the next 24-48 hours. Act now, or pay full price later.

When your visitors click the link to go to www.your-website.tld/go/amazon/, they are seamlessly redirected to the original URL at www.amazon.com.</p>\n<p>Link masking has two benefits: First, it lets you replace lengthy affiliate URLs with short, clean, internal URL masks (using 301 redirects, which have no search engine penalty). Second, Link Mask Generator automatically generates robots.txt rules that disallow your masked URLs, effectively neutering the juice-flow of the link, without resorting to the rel nofollow attribute. This combination makes Link Mask Generator a perfect tool for affiliate marketers.</p>\n<p>The latest releases of SEO Ultimate expand on this existing functionality by adding a new global interface which lets you see all your link masks in one place and which lets you apply a link mask globally instead of just to one post as before.</p>\n<p>Just go to the new &#8220;Link Mask Generator&#8221; menu item under SEO Ultimate&#8217;s &#8220;SEO&#8221; menu in your WordPresss admin to view and edit the alias list. The alias table includes a field for the actual URL (e.g. www.amazon.com), a field for the alias URL (e.g. /go/amazon/), a &#8220;test&#8221; link that lets you check that the alias URL is working, and an optional &#8220;Only on This Post&#8221; field that lets you limit the application of the link mask to a specific post (thereby emulating the functionality of the previous version of Link Mask Generator).</p>\n<p>If you have an affiliate URL that you use in multiple posts across your entire site, the new version of Link Mask Generator lets you mask all instances of that URL in one fell swoop.</p>\n<h3>Deeplink Juggernaut &amp; Link Mask Generator Integration</h3>\n<p>One of the great things about having all your SEO features in one plugin is that the modules can integrate with each other. Deeplink Juggernaut and Link Mask Generator can now work together starting with SEO Ultimate 7.1, allowing you to use link masks as autolinking destinations in Deeplink Juggernaut.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve already used Link Mask Generator to mask all your www.amazon.com links with internal /go/amazon/ URLs. Now let&#8217;s say you want to autolink all instances of the word &#8220;Amazon&#8221; to your new /go/amazon/ URL. Just go to the &#8220;Add a New Link&#8221; section of the &#8220;Content Links&#8221; tab of Deeplink Juggernaut, type &#8220;Amazon&#8221; in the &#8220;Anchor Text&#8221; box, and type &#8220;amazon&#8221; in the &#8220;Destination&#8221; box. Then click the /go/amazon/ item that appears in the dropdown beneath the &#8220;Destination&#8221; box. Then just click Save Changes to add the new autolink.</p>\n<p>Now all instances of the word &#8220;Amazon&#8221; (in our example) will autolink to http://www.your-website.tld/go/amazon/. When a visitor clicks the link, he or she will be silently redirected to the original URL at www.amazon.com.</p>\n<p>This conjunction of Deeplink Juggernaut and Link Mask Generator functionality is a perfect combo for affiliate marketers looking to autolink all instances of a relevant keyword to a masked affiliate URL.</p>\n<h3>More Features, Changes, &amp; Fixes</h3>\n<p>Those 2 features are the headline additions to the latest versions of SEO Ultimate, but there&#8217;s even more worth mentioning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Permalink Tweaker now includes a new setting that lets you handle URL conflicts between pages and categories/tags that can arise when you use Permalink Tweaker to remove category/tag URL bases. For example, if you have a category called &#8220;Blue Widgets&#8221; and a page called &#8220;Blue Widgets,&#8221; and if you have configured Permalink Tweaker to remove the /category/ portion of your categories&#8217; URLs, then both the page and the category will have the URL of http://www.your-website.tld/blue-widgets/. As of SEO Ultimate 7.2, Permalink Tweaker includes a new &#8220;URL Conflict Resolution&#8221; setting that lets you choose whether the category or the page should get the URL in case of a conflict.</li>\n<li>In previous versions of SEO Ultimate, modules had multiple help dropdowns (in the upper-right-hand corner of the module admin pages) containing module documentation, such as &#8220;Overview,&#8221; &#8220;FAQ,&#8221; &#8220;Troubleshooting,&#8221; etc. As of version 7.0 and later, SEO Ultimate now uses the new help system of WordPress 3.3 that places all these documentation sections into a single &#8220;Help&#8221; dropdown with multiple tabs.</li>\n<li>Deeplink Juggernaut&#8217;s &#8220;Tag Restrictions&#8221; setting should now handle nested tags with aplomb. If you&#8217;ve configured Deeplink Juggernaut to refrain from autolinking within &lt;h3&gt; tags, for example, this setting will now take effect even if that &lt;h3&gt; tag has a nested &lt;span&gt; tag or &lt;br /&gt; tag. If this bug has been giving you trouble, upgrade to SEO Ultimate 7.2.1 or later and let us know whether the fix is working for you.</li>\n<li>Meta Description Editor now lets you differentiate your meta descriptions on paginated subpages of categories, tags, and pages. For example, you can use Meta Description Editor to automatically tack on &#8220;Page 2&#8243; to the end of the meta description of page 2 of a category archive. This new feature helps avoid &#8220;duplicate meta description&#8221; errors in Google Webmaster Tools.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download version 7.2.1 today to enjoy the new features and multiple enhancements.

Do this with hundreds of RSS aggregators or syndication sources and you can get hundreds of links per day (just from adding one page of content).</p>\n<p>This method is easy to implement with <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"WordPress SEO\">WordPress</a> (if you have a content development strategy in place) to drip fresh content.</p>\n<p>Each new page or post published represents another opportunity to leverage and syndicate that content (to build links back to the original page) which can eventually sprout PageRank and pass ranking factor to your <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-landing-pages/\">preferred landing pages</a>.</p>\n<p>Those <em>link-rich</em> hub pages also double as places to build solid <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">secondary navigation</a> or internal links to your commercial landing pages or other hub pages in your website to enhance search engine positioning.</p>\n<h3>Link Signals</h3>\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/\" title=\"Search Engine Optimization\">search engine optimization</a> is that search engines are programmed to suppress <strong>new link signals</strong> (for passing ranking factor) until they pass a certain criteria of trust.</p>\n<p>The link/trust threshold  is <strong>the secret sauce</strong> known only by a select group of developers from Google, Yahoo and Bing. The prime directive of this filter to keep their search engine indices less polluted (from aggressive <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo-link-building.html\" title=\"Link Building\">link building</a> tactics).</p>\n<p>The good news is, if you are building links properly, you can get past this filter by layering permanent one way links strategically over time.</p>\n<p>I have witnessed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> the <em>first phase</em> at approximately <strong>10-14 days</strong> (to sprout a ranking from inbound links)</li>\n<li>the <em>second phase</em> of a the link /trust cycle is estimated at <strong>40-45 days</strong></li>\n<li>the <em>third phase</em> in the link-flow cycle typically occurs in the <strong>90-120 day</strong> range and</li>\n<li>the <em>fourth</em> <em>phase</em> occurs <strong>after 6-8 months</strong> &#8211; and continues to pass more value as time progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the 8 month threshold, a backlink is stable and well on it&#8217;s way to gaining trust and passing along its total link flow to the target site. This suggests that as links age, they pass more ranking factor.</p>\n<p>The three primary factors that impact this algorithm are  (1) the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/with-seo-time-and-authority-are-on-your-side/\">age/time of the link</a> and (2) the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/seo-rankings-trust-and-relevance-signals/\">relevancy of the link</a> and (3) page strength as determined by the number of inbound / outbound links on the page providing the link.</p>\n<p>As an aspect of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/finding-the-right-link-velocity-to-complement-seo/\">link velocity</a>, the rate in which you gain and / or lose inbound links impacts a website, but also, the age (as mentioned above) dramatically impacts ranking.</p>\n<p>We can speculate the reason for this, but rather than look at the nuts and bolts of the algo, simply think like a developer and put yourself in the shoes of the programmers crafting the coding symphony known as Google’s search algorithm.</p>\n<p>How would you keep new links from being disruptive (if automated or otherwise) if they passed 100% ranking factor out of the gate? This would be an open invitation for automation (which could easily skew search engine result page results) from a barrage or spike of links.</p>\n<h3>Factoring The Link Grandfather Effect</h3>\n<p>The answer to this quandary, merely think of it as an algorithmic <strong>link-throttle </strong>that essentially limits how much link-juice links produce based on specific thresholds.</p>\n<p>Put simply, as links age, they pass more trust, trust translates into (a) PageRank (b) link-flow which in turn pass ranking factor along the link graph to the target page (which eventually becomes more buoyant (until it collides with the next page above it who has more relevance score) and then subsides in the search engine result pages.</p>\n<p>Aside from the off page inbound links, their age and relevancy,  typically on page factors or the degree of your on page efficiency determines how many off page inbound links are required to cross the tipping point.</p>\n<p>Each website varies based on the competition in the marketplace, the on site architecture, the volume and integrity of the internal links, the age of the site, how each page is fed in the hierarchy and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">how many shingles</a> (supporting keyword occurrences) or internal links based on <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/how-semantic-connectivity-affects-seo/\">semantic overlap</a> are present.</p>\n<p>So, if you understand that it’s not always backlinks that push rankings higher, it’s capping link-loss and trust from the pre-existing inbound links or strong internal pages getting more link-flow and pushing it to the appropriate silo (preferred landing page) of the semantic theme that make this a powerful <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization-myths/on-page-off-page-seo/\">on page and off page SEO</a> combination.</p>\n<p>One quick way to give your rankings a boost is (a) build links to your links or (b) go back to published URL’s and syndicate them across multiple feeds (to get more page level citation) which in turn translates into buoyant rankings.</p>\n<p>The takeaway here is (1) use <strong>content syndication</strong> and aggregators to steadily build a stream of inbound deep links to internal pages and (2) use the collective <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/understanding-link-prominence-volume-velocity-flow-and-distribution/\">link-weight</a> they produce to rank <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-tips-for-theming-and-siloing/\">multiple semantic themes</a> within your website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=EayqR2C4Nqk:FT7sH1odXB0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/EayqR2C4Nqk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}s:11:\"description\";s:332:\"Is there such a thing in SEO as the off-page inbound link sweet spot?

Do this with hundreds of RSS aggregators or syndication sources and you can get hundreds of links per day (just from adding one page of content).</p>\n<p>This method is easy to implement with <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/wordpress-seo/\" title=\"WordPress SEO\">WordPress</a> (if you have a content development strategy in place) to drip fresh content.</p>\n<p>Each new page or post published represents another opportunity to leverage and syndicate that content (to build links back to the original page) which can eventually sprout PageRank and pass ranking factor to your <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-landing-pages/\">preferred landing pages</a>.</p>\n<p>Those <em>link-rich</em> hub pages also double as places to build solid <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">secondary navigation</a> or internal links to your commercial landing pages or other hub pages in your website to enhance search engine positioning.</p>\n<h3>Link Signals</h3>\n<p>One often overlooked aspect of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/\" title=\"Search Engine Optimization\">search engine optimization</a> is that search engines are programmed to suppress <strong>new link signals</strong> (for passing ranking factor) until they pass a certain criteria of trust.</p>\n<p>The link/trust threshold  is <strong>the secret sauce</strong> known only by a select group of developers from Google, Yahoo and Bing. The prime directive of this filter to keep their search engine indices less polluted (from aggressive <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo-link-building.html\" title=\"Link Building\">link building</a> tactics).</p>\n<p>The good news is, if you are building links properly, you can get past this filter by layering permanent one way links strategically over time.</p>\n<p>I have witnessed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li> the <em>first phase</em> at approximately <strong>10-14 days</strong> (to sprout a ranking from inbound links)</li>\n<li>the <em>second phase</em> of a the link /trust cycle is estimated at <strong>40-45 days</strong></li>\n<li>the <em>third phase</em> in the link-flow cycle typically occurs in the <strong>90-120 day</strong> range and</li>\n<li>the <em>fourth</em> <em>phase</em> occurs <strong>after 6-8 months</strong> &#8211; and continues to pass more value as time progresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After the 8 month threshold, a backlink is stable and well on it&#8217;s way to gaining trust and passing along its total link flow to the target site. This suggests that as links age, they pass more ranking factor.</p>\n<p>The three primary factors that impact this algorithm are  (1) the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/with-seo-time-and-authority-are-on-your-side/\">age/time of the link</a> and (2) the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/seo-rankings-trust-and-relevance-signals/\">relevancy of the link</a> and (3) page strength as determined by the number of inbound / outbound links on the page providing the link.</p>\n<p>As an aspect of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/finding-the-right-link-velocity-to-complement-seo/\">link velocity</a>, the rate in which you gain and / or lose inbound links impacts a website, but also, the age (as mentioned above) dramatically impacts ranking.</p>\n<p>We can speculate the reason for this, but rather than look at the nuts and bolts of the algo, simply think like a developer and put yourself in the shoes of the programmers crafting the coding symphony known as Google’s search algorithm.</p>\n<p>How would you keep new links from being disruptive (if automated or otherwise) if they passed 100% ranking factor out of the gate? This would be an open invitation for automation (which could easily skew search engine result page results) from a barrage or spike of links.</p>\n<h3>Factoring The Link Grandfather Effect</h3>\n<p>The answer to this quandary, merely think of it as an algorithmic <strong>link-throttle </strong>that essentially limits how much link-juice links produce based on specific thresholds.</p>\n<p>Put simply, as links age, they pass more trust, trust translates into (a) PageRank (b) link-flow which in turn pass ranking factor along the link graph to the target page (which eventually becomes more buoyant (until it collides with the next page above it who has more relevance score) and then subsides in the search engine result pages.</p>\n<p>Aside from the off page inbound links, their age and relevancy,  typically on page factors or the degree of your on page efficiency determines how many off page inbound links are required to cross the tipping point.</p>\n<p>Each website varies based on the competition in the marketplace, the on site architecture, the volume and integrity of the internal links, the age of the site, how each page is fed in the hierarchy and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">how many shingles</a> (supporting keyword occurrences) or internal links based on <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/how-semantic-connectivity-affects-seo/\">semantic overlap</a> are present.</p>\n<p>So, if you understand that it’s not always backlinks that push rankings higher, it’s capping link-loss and trust from the pre-existing inbound links or strong internal pages getting more link-flow and pushing it to the appropriate silo (preferred landing page) of the semantic theme that make this a powerful <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization-myths/on-page-off-page-seo/\">on page and off page SEO</a> combination.</p>\n<p>One quick way to give your rankings a boost is (a) build links to your links or (b) go back to published URL’s and syndicate them across multiple feeds (to get more page level citation) which in turn translates into buoyant rankings.</p>\n<p>The takeaway here is (1) use <strong>content syndication</strong> and aggregators to steadily build a stream of inbound deep links to internal pages and (2) use the collective <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/understanding-link-prominence-volume-velocity-flow-and-distribution/\">link-weight</a> they produce to rank <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-tips-for-theming-and-siloing/\">multiple semantic themes</a> within your website.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=EayqR2C4Nqk:FT7sH1odXB0:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/EayqR2C4Nqk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}i:22;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:56:\"Gain Access to Michael Campbell’s Dynamic Media Vault!\";s:4:\"link\";s:77:\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/6smTuMPoyBY/\";s:8:\"category\";s:165:\"Affiliate MarketingAccess the Internet Marketing VaultAffiliate Marketing StrategiesAffiliate Marketing TacticsAffiliate TipsMichael CampbellMichael Campbell\'s Vault\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:13:\"Jeffrey_Smith\";}s:7:\"pubdate\";s:29:\"Wed, 16 Nov 2011 07:04:57 PST\";s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/?p=9026\";s:7:\"content\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";s:3473:\"<p>It’s rare that I endorse anything or anyone, but there has been someone from the affiliate marketing space who has always delivered mind-shattering, truthful, no-frills advice on internet marketing time and time again.

Your interpretation of link building should be (links come in various types but if used in the right context, each type has a place) if you are using a tiered approach (to deep to discuss in this brief post).</p>\n<h3>Implementing Shingle Diversity</h3>\n<p>While there are no absolutes, merely consider these suggestions ideal guidelines for building a more robust and / or natural link profile.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the domain name or website address  in 10% of inbound links (ideally to the homepage)</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-seo-your-website/\">primary shingle</a> “exact match” keyword to a preferred silo landing page (a page built specifically for that keyword” approximately 35% of the time while keeping link velocity in mind (not building or losing links too fast) while linking to it from the homepage or other strong navigational or silo landing pages from “<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">contextual links</a>”.</li>\n<li>Use an alternative variations 15% of the time (to mix up the natural inbound link diversity) such as juxtaposed shingles, or synonyms mixed with the primary keyword.</li>\n<li>Use long tail variations 20% of the time (whereby the keyword is surrounded by the primary keyword and / or additional modifiers either before or after the shingles.</li>\n<li>Use the plural variation 20% of the time (building both singular and plural variations ensures you rank for both).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also remember, the same applies for internal links, except for the diversity should be less, but still incorporate a variety of shingles, depending on the method you are utilizing. For example, in order to boost one keyword, then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build the same anchor text shingle (group of words) to the primary landing page from within the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make the page rank for <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/seo-rankings-and-how-to-create-them/\">additional keyword variations</a> / keyword queries (that either appear on the page or are linked form pages designed to rank for those shingles) which are in essence “<strong>passing along</strong>” their link-flow and authority to the target page. For that method of on page / off page SEO ratios use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a mixed ratio of primary internal links to the target / preferred landing page</li>\n<li> Use a mixed ratio of off page inbound links to make the page rank for the spread of aggregate links in the anchor text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The extent of the result depends on (a) competitors (b) domain and page strength (c) trust passed from the citation of the collective links and (d) the percentage of on page and off page inbound links to a page.</p>\n<p>The takeaway here is diversity is the spice of life, and also applies when building internal or inbound back links. So, mix it up (your anchor text) to get past stale rankings and strengthen the link profile of your websites. Ultimately the ratios are up to you, but at least you have a method to fall back for a skeleton when it comes to shingle usage and links (either internal or inbound).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=a1yVfIhjp24:Y0N922qjWXM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/a1yVfIhjp24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}s:11:\"description\";s:347:\"Aside from enjoying using the word “obfuscate” in a sentence, the meaning is clear for SEO when considering link building.

Your interpretation of link building should be (links come in various types but if used in the right context, each type has a place) if you are using a tiered approach (to deep to discuss in this brief post).</p>\n<h3>Implementing Shingle Diversity</h3>\n<p>While there are no absolutes, merely consider these suggestions ideal guidelines for building a more robust and / or natural link profile.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use the domain name or website address  in 10% of inbound links (ideally to the homepage)</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-seo-your-website/\">primary shingle</a> “exact match” keyword to a preferred silo landing page (a page built specifically for that keyword” approximately 35% of the time while keeping link velocity in mind (not building or losing links too fast) while linking to it from the homepage or other strong navigational or silo landing pages from “<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\">contextual links</a>”.</li>\n<li>Use an alternative variations 15% of the time (to mix up the natural inbound link diversity) such as juxtaposed shingles, or synonyms mixed with the primary keyword.</li>\n<li>Use long tail variations 20% of the time (whereby the keyword is surrounded by the primary keyword and / or additional modifiers either before or after the shingles.</li>\n<li>Use the plural variation 20% of the time (building both singular and plural variations ensures you rank for both).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also remember, the same applies for internal links, except for the diversity should be less, but still incorporate a variety of shingles, depending on the method you are utilizing. For example, in order to boost one keyword, then:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build the same anchor text shingle (group of words) to the primary landing page from within the site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To make the page rank for <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/seo-rankings-and-how-to-create-them/\">additional keyword variations</a> / keyword queries (that either appear on the page or are linked form pages designed to rank for those shingles) which are in essence “<strong>passing along</strong>” their link-flow and authority to the target page. For that method of on page / off page SEO ratios use:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use a mixed ratio of primary internal links to the target / preferred landing page</li>\n<li> Use a mixed ratio of off page inbound links to make the page rank for the spread of aggregate links in the anchor text.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The extent of the result depends on (a) competitors (b) domain and page strength (c) trust passed from the citation of the collective links and (d) the percentage of on page and off page inbound links to a page.</p>\n<p>The takeaway here is diversity is the spice of life, and also applies when building internal or inbound back links. So, mix it up (your anchor text) to get past stale rankings and strengthen the link profile of your websites. Ultimately the ratios are up to you, but at least you have a method to fall back for a skeleton when it comes to shingle usage and links (either internal or inbound).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=a1yVfIhjp24:Y0N922qjWXM:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/a1yVfIhjp24\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}i:24;a:12:{s:5:\"title\";s:51:\"Which Links Pass the Most Weight in Search Engines?\";s:4:\"link\";s:77:\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/sUdzMIoZu7s/\";s:8:\"category\";s:74:\"SEO ConsultingAdvanced On Page SEOlink flowLink WeightOn Page Optimization\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:13:\"Jeffrey_Smith\";}s:7:\"pubdate\";s:29:\"Fri, 04 Nov 2011 01:43:08 PDT\";s:4:\"guid\";s:46:\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/?p=9012\";s:7:\"content\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";s:12500:\"<p>Link weight and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/why-internal-links-are-more-important-than-backlinks/\">link-flow</a> are the most critical on page elements after you (1) map out which keywords you’re targeting (2) mirror the relevance hierarchy through the site architecture through the respective pillars (landing pages) and supporting articles and (3) initiate the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/maximizing-market-share-with-seo-modifiers/\">citation process</a> via internal linking and off page inbound links.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_9014\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/which-links-pass-the-most-weight-in-search-engines/\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-9014\" title=\"link-weight\" src=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/link-weight.jpg\" alt=\"On Page Link-Flow and Link Weight\" width=\"440\" height=\"300\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Which Links Pass the Most Link-Flow and Link Weight?</p></div>\n<p>However, before you initiate any type of off page <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo/\" title=\"SEO\">SEO</a> (building inbound links); make sure that you aren’t building your internal links by relying on minimal navigational links alone.</p>\n<p>If you fail to map out your on page elements, it’s the equivalent of trying to fill a <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/dealing-with-link-loss/\">leaky bucket</a> full of water to no avail.

Rankings are driven from understanding (a) the proper amount of shingles, internal links and deep links, backed by (b) the amount of trust and authority developed as a byproduct, percolation and time to achieve the authority set in Google (the page in which all other less perfect pages deemed by the algorithm) are measured.</p>\n<p>By chipping away with semantically aligned topical nodes of content, supporting synonyms and blanketing the relevance landscape, your websites base expands and the process of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/10-seo-tips-to-triple-keyword-visibility/\">keyword stemming</a> is no longer a theory, but a byproduct of tactful content development aligned with on page and off page citation (via internal links)and syndication (validation from citation from off page sources).</p>\n<p>To keep the post from spilling over into a 4000 word whitepaper, we can continue the conversation at a later date.

Combine this with website silo architecture and a powerful collection of strong, topical backlinks to your silo landing pages and you have a trifecta that makes Wikipedia, Amazon and Fortune 500 companies a ripple in your wake as you devour the top 10 positions on your way to the top.</p>\n<p>We do with a few hundred links what most do with thousands. Rankings are driven from understanding (a) the proper amount of shingles, internal links and deep links, backed by (b) the amount of trust and authority developed as a byproduct, percolation and time to achieve the authority set in Google (the page in which all other less perfect pages deemed by the algorithm) are measured.</p>\n<p>By chipping away with semantically aligned topical nodes of content, supporting synonyms and blanketing the relevance landscape, your websites base expands and the process of <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-tips/10-seo-tips-to-triple-keyword-visibility/\">keyword stemming</a> is no longer a theory, but a byproduct of tactful content development aligned with on page and off page citation (via internal links)and syndication (validation from citation from off page sources).</p>\n<p>To keep the post from spilling over into a 4000 word whitepaper, we can continue the conversation at a later date. I plan to create a video to follow up and showcase how (with the proper understanding) you can map and / or correct link-flow imbalance within a website particularly when <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/dws-2-5-update-tools-seo-campaign-management/\">mapping out shingles</a> for on page content and internal links, in addition to deep links to create a ranking juggernaut.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, if you want to schedule an SEO consultation for your website to map out link-flow, <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo/\">visit this page</a> or <a href=\"mailto:support@seodesignsolutions.com\">email us</a> to get started (hourly rate billed at $400/hr).</p>\n<p>Link-flow is the lifeblood of your website.

In this instance you need to survey the reach and exposure of your competitors (content, links, advertising budget, whether or not they are using affiliates, etc.) in order to surmise their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Based on your discovery, you look for chinks in the armor to determine whether or not their weakness will serve your advance.</p>\n<p>For example, if your competitor is relying solely on one type of promotion too heavily, that would provide you with an opportunity to leverage a medium they may be ignoring (like Press releases, editorial content swapping on powerful websites, powerhouse aged directories or even selective article marketing &#8211; <em>to get tons of long tail inbound links to your landing pages</em>).</p>\n<p>Study their rankings, see where they are visible and start with a solid plan that you can (a) roll out as aggressively as your budget permits but (b) is founded in a timeline with KPI’s (<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/seo-and-kpi-key-performance-indicators/\">key performance indicators</a>) as a sounding board for advancement and ROI (return on investment).</p>\n<p>Be aware it may take 6-9 months to get a foothold for competitive verticals, but the traffic is your reward (if you cultivate positioning on the appropriate keyword/fronts).</p>\n<h3>PERSISTENCE</h3>\n<p>Persistence – Are you the kind of guy (or girl) that picks a fight with an 800 pound gorilla, then once you get hit in the face throw in the towel and give up? If so, then SEO is not for you (you are better off paying for every click with PPC or media buys).</p>\n<p>Persistence is one of your most notable allies in the battles that erupt with the other 990 contenders on your ascent to the top 10. If you crumble easily or get flustered if you rise 5 pages for a few weeks, then fall back 2 pages, then reconsider your resolve.</p>\n<p>Search engine result pages (SERPs) are volatile, as there are hundreds of known factors and thousands of variables which contribute to a website remaining buoyant amidst the chaos of recency and relevance in addition to competitors all aiming to <strong>take your spot</strong>.</p>\n<p>You have to stay active in order to impress search engine algorithms, and that means using diversity (in keywords, internal links, the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-basics/content-creation/\">content you publish</a> on site and how you reinforce that content through syndication or off page ranking factors).</p>\n<p>The key is to keep things moving and to scale <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/is-your-on-page-seo-strong-enough/\">on page SEO</a> equally while focusing on promotion and off page (links and syndication). We never advise any type of SEO campaign without recommending the addition of fresh, topical content being dripped daily to the web from the property you are trying to establish.</p>\n<p>On page content sends a clear signal that your effort is genuine and each new page gives you an opportunity to reinforce another shingle (group of words) that are pieces in the puzzle (parts of the semantic hierarchy) that you are attempting to establish a foothold in.</p>\n<p>The more keywords your website spans, the more relevant your website becomes. The more relevant your website becomes, the more search engines will funnel traffic to your pages. The more traffic and exposure you receive, the more you can leverage those ranked pages to rank 10 more in kind and in essence develop a ranking juggernaut.</p>\n<p>This is a worthy strategy for conquest, building an authority site to weather SERP fluctuations and lazy competitors. All the while, this is only part one of the equation. When you couple this with progressive off page inbound links (over time) all keywords are attainable (if you cross the tipping point).</p>\n<p>The question is, do you have the commitment, persistence, drive, budget or time to do so. If you are up against a competitor who has been dominant for 5 years uncontested by a challenger, then be prepared to engage the battle (when they see you picking off keywords and taking their spots).</p>\n<p>This is why the next virtue is of extreme importance… that virtue is patience.</p>\n<h3>PATIENCE</h3>\n<p>Patience is not a naturally occurring trait for most; it must be developed over time. SEO requires time and much like a great battle or game of chess getting to the end game with an advantage all depends on what moves you made in the beginning or previous moves leading up to it.</p>\n<p>While there are various strategies and tactics, they are mere pieces on the board.

In this instance you need to survey the reach and exposure of your competitors (content, links, advertising budget, whether or not they are using affiliates, etc.) in order to surmise their strengths and weaknesses.</p>\n<p>Based on your discovery, you look for chinks in the armor to determine whether or not their weakness will serve your advance.</p>\n<p>For example, if your competitor is relying solely on one type of promotion too heavily, that would provide you with an opportunity to leverage a medium they may be ignoring (like Press releases, editorial content swapping on powerful websites, powerhouse aged directories or even selective article marketing &#8211; <em>to get tons of long tail inbound links to your landing pages</em>).</p>\n<p>Study their rankings, see where they are visible and start with a solid plan that you can (a) roll out as aggressively as your budget permits but (b) is founded in a timeline with KPI’s (<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/seo-and-kpi-key-performance-indicators/\">key performance indicators</a>) as a sounding board for advancement and ROI (return on investment).</p>\n<p>Be aware it may take 6-9 months to get a foothold for competitive verticals, but the traffic is your reward (if you cultivate positioning on the appropriate keyword/fronts).</p>\n<h3>PERSISTENCE</h3>\n<p>Persistence – Are you the kind of guy (or girl) that picks a fight with an 800 pound gorilla, then once you get hit in the face throw in the towel and give up? If so, then SEO is not for you (you are better off paying for every click with PPC or media buys).</p>\n<p>Persistence is one of your most notable allies in the battles that erupt with the other 990 contenders on your ascent to the top 10. If you crumble easily or get flustered if you rise 5 pages for a few weeks, then fall back 2 pages, then reconsider your resolve.</p>\n<p>Search engine result pages (SERPs) are volatile, as there are hundreds of known factors and thousands of variables which contribute to a website remaining buoyant amidst the chaos of recency and relevance in addition to competitors all aiming to <strong>take your spot</strong>.</p>\n<p>You have to stay active in order to impress search engine algorithms, and that means using diversity (in keywords, internal links, the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-basics/content-creation/\">content you publish</a> on site and how you reinforce that content through syndication or off page ranking factors).</p>\n<p>The key is to keep things moving and to scale <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/is-your-on-page-seo-strong-enough/\">on page SEO</a> equally while focusing on promotion and off page (links and syndication). We never advise any type of SEO campaign without recommending the addition of fresh, topical content being dripped daily to the web from the property you are trying to establish.</p>\n<p>On page content sends a clear signal that your effort is genuine and each new page gives you an opportunity to reinforce another shingle (group of words) that are pieces in the puzzle (parts of the semantic hierarchy) that you are attempting to establish a foothold in.</p>\n<p>The more keywords your website spans, the more relevant your website becomes. The more relevant your website becomes, the more search engines will funnel traffic to your pages. The more traffic and exposure you receive, the more you can leverage those ranked pages to rank 10 more in kind and in essence develop a ranking juggernaut.</p>\n<p>This is a worthy strategy for conquest, building an authority site to weather SERP fluctuations and lazy competitors. All the while, this is only part one of the equation. When you couple this with progressive off page inbound links (over time) all keywords are attainable (if you cross the tipping point).</p>\n<p>The question is, do you have the commitment, persistence, drive, budget or time to do so. If you are up against a competitor who has been dominant for 5 years uncontested by a challenger, then be prepared to engage the battle (when they see you picking off keywords and taking their spots).</p>\n<p>This is why the next virtue is of extreme importance… that virtue is patience.</p>\n<h3>PATIENCE</h3>\n<p>Patience is not a naturally occurring trait for most; it must be developed over time. SEO requires time and much like a great battle or game of chess getting to the end game with an advantage all depends on what moves you made in the beginning or previous moves leading up to it.</p>\n<p>While there are various strategies and tactics, they are mere pieces on the board. What matters is how they are used (leverage), when you use them (timing) and why you would elect to use them in the first place (circumstance).  To sift through the archives of our strategies, you need look no further than our <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/sitemap.xml\">sitemap</a> for gems.

While your first reaction is panic (in fear of an <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo/\" title=\"SEO\">SEO</a> penalty), the reason for the usurping could potentially be derived from a variety of equally substantial causes, such as:<span id=\"more-8981\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google or other search engine algorithms are merely testing a new filter.</li>\n<li>The search index is being rebuilt (where old pages are scored in contrast to new entries and aged contenders), which often settles and your ranking / position reemerges.</li>\n<li>The link flow (rank order) of your pages shifted from making changes to your website.</li>\n<li>Some of your own pages and / or internal links have lost value from (a) duplicity (b) low value content or (c) potential indexation issues or the most obvious…</li>\n<li> Competition has kicked their SEO in gear to take your spot!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While frustration from any of these causes can make even the most calm, collected business owner or webmaster uneasy, there are ways you can stave these vacillations by either creating additional padding within your website (theming) that insulates your primary pages (by reinforcing them with internal links) and / or creating stronger trust signals that omit your website from the churn.</p>\n<p>While no website is immune, there are varying degrees of displacement which can occur as the search engine index is like an organism <em>in its own right</em> vastly spanning billions of documents with the constant yet prime directive to find the best 10 pages for any given search query.</p>\n<h3>Okay, Einstein Now What?</h3>\n<p>Most causes are algorithmic, so, if you address and make the appropriate change, stability returns. The question is, what can you do about it today? So, here are 10 tested SEO solutions you can start with right now in your vetting process:</p>\n<p>1)      <strong>Revise Titles:</strong> Check your titles (to see if you can remove any noise) and refine relevance. Excessive titles diffuse relevance, so, make sure they are succinct and only reference the content on THAT page, not something general. Follow the link for more information about <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-optimize-meta-titles-and-descriptions/\">optimizing titles and meta descriptions</a>.</p>\n<p>2)      <strong>Indexed Pages:</strong> Use the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amydomain.com\">site:mydomain.com</a> command [replace mydomain.com with your own domain name in a Google search] to see if you have lost an inordinate amount of pages. If you had 1000 pages indexed and now you have 100, there are crawl or sever issues which could cripple your websites link flow. If you are suffering from indexation issues then pages that are not in the index are no longer passing ranking factor as supporting pages.</p>\n<p>3)      <strong>Inflated indexation:</strong> like the contrary and not having enough pages indexed, sometimes your website/server will create a hiccup and pages will get indexed multiple times. If this happens, then your website can trigger duplicate content penalties (where multiple pages have the same data and go supplemental) in other words, they will not rank in Google’s primary index (which is what you are querying, Google’s snapshot from their spiders, not the web) when you are searching using THEIR engine.</p>\n<p>4)      <strong>Add content:</strong> Add more unique content to primary landing pages. Ensuring your pages have at least 500-750 words of unique content for primary landing page can aid relevance and authority. This is critical because a search engine is programmed to look for co-occurrence (the presence and proximity of other supporting synonyms and / or related keywords) to ascertain relevance.</p>\n<p>5)      <strong>Target Specific Landing Pages:</strong> Make sure primary keywords have the appropriate landing pages. For example, instead of the homepage ranking for everything, use a keyword specific landing page. Not only does this help on page conversions from message match (giving a user what they expect when they click through) but it also adds another layer to your SEO for <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/seo-and-deep-linking/\">deep links</a> (building backlinks to pages other than the homepage) see next item for elaboration.</p>\n<p>6)      <strong>Build Deep Links:</strong> By building specific links to <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/keywords-and-landing-pages/\">keyword-rich landing pages</a> designed specifically for the keyword, you can dramatically increase rankings by consolidating on page SEO efforts.</p>\n<p>This means if you have a category called electronics, and you have different sub categories (portable electronics, USB accessories, wireless accessories), then create specific pages for those sub categories and then build links to them from other websites with the keyword those sub categories/landing pages should rank for (portable electronics, USB accessories or Wireless Accessories, respectively). This also strengthens the category (Electronics) and all the pages it links to.</p>\n<p>7)      <strong>Remove Excessive Links: </strong>If you have excessive internal links on a page (particularly boilerplate links that appear on multiple pages) then you are better off minimizing the amount of outbound/internal links to under 50 links per page (up to 100 links max) when internally linking your pages.</p>\n<p>This accomplished two things (1) it make the page preserve more ranking factor and (2) excessive links won&#8217;t bleed ranking factor for the pages you link to. The more links you have on a page, the weaker each one becomes, so, keep your on page SEO tight and link only as needed.

You can do this by (a) syndicating old content on the site (rewriting it and submitting to article directories, RSS directories, using <a href=\"http://www.pingler.com/\">www.pingler.com</a> or getting fresh links from press releases like <a href=\"http://www.prweb.com/\">www.prweb.com</a> to create more IP diversity.</p>\n<p>9)      <strong>Diversify Internal Link Anchor Text: </strong>While you think that linking the same keyword <strong>from every page in your website</strong> to one target page might help, if done in excess, you can toggle an internal <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/how-to-avoid-seo-over-optimization/\">over-optimization penalty</a>.</p>\n<p>To correct this, use link-caps (determine and implement a cut-off point) and then use alternate keywords and / or synonyms to link to primary landing pages. The benefit is (1) the target page still has the overlapping keywords so the primary phrase gets a boost and (2) the target page can rank for a broader array of keyword variations (<a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/which-types-of-keywords-are-best-for-seo/\">mid-tail and long-tail keywords</a>).</p>\n<p>10)   <strong>Time:</strong> Sometimes you need to give everything more time.

While your first reaction is panic (in fear of an <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo/\" title=\"SEO\">SEO</a> penalty), the reason for the usurping could potentially be derived from a variety of equally substantial causes, such as:<span id=\"more-8981\"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google or other search engine algorithms are merely testing a new filter.</li>\n<li>The search index is being rebuilt (where old pages are scored in contrast to new entries and aged contenders), which often settles and your ranking / position reemerges.</li>\n<li>The link flow (rank order) of your pages shifted from making changes to your website.</li>\n<li>Some of your own pages and / or internal links have lost value from (a) duplicity (b) low value content or (c) potential indexation issues or the most obvious…</li>\n<li> Competition has kicked their SEO in gear to take your spot!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While frustration from any of these causes can make even the most calm, collected business owner or webmaster uneasy, there are ways you can stave these vacillations by either creating additional padding within your website (theming) that insulates your primary pages (by reinforcing them with internal links) and / or creating stronger trust signals that omit your website from the churn.</p>\n<p>While no website is immune, there are varying degrees of displacement which can occur as the search engine index is like an organism <em>in its own right</em> vastly spanning billions of documents with the constant yet prime directive to find the best 10 pages for any given search query.</p>\n<h3>Okay, Einstein Now What?</h3>\n<p>Most causes are algorithmic, so, if you address and make the appropriate change, stability returns. The question is, what can you do about it today? So, here are 10 tested SEO solutions you can start with right now in your vetting process:</p>\n<p>1)      <strong>Revise Titles:</strong> Check your titles (to see if you can remove any noise) and refine relevance. Excessive titles diffuse relevance, so, make sure they are succinct and only reference the content on THAT page, not something general. Follow the link for more information about <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/how-to-optimize-meta-titles-and-descriptions/\">optimizing titles and meta descriptions</a>.</p>\n<p>2)      <strong>Indexed Pages:</strong> Use the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Amydomain.com\">site:mydomain.com</a> command [replace mydomain.com with your own domain name in a Google search] to see if you have lost an inordinate amount of pages. If you had 1000 pages indexed and now you have 100, there are crawl or sever issues which could cripple your websites link flow. If you are suffering from indexation issues then pages that are not in the index are no longer passing ranking factor as supporting pages.</p>\n<p>3)      <strong>Inflated indexation:</strong> like the contrary and not having enough pages indexed, sometimes your website/server will create a hiccup and pages will get indexed multiple times.

Why, you might ask? Because as your website grows, your opportunity to raise your website’s SEO ceiling (the range of competitive keywords you can rank for by default/virtue of your websites trust, age and theme) shift and evolve concurrently.<span id=\"more-8968\"></span></p>\n<p>For example, approaching SEO (without <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/authority-site-building-and-leveraging-website-authority/\">website authority</a>), you might think of producing rankings the hard way (trying to rank before you have the clout and authority using links alone) vs. building authority and rankings emerging as if by default from the correlation of your <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/is-your-on-page-seo-strong-enough/\">on site optimization</a> strategy with minimal off site dependency.</p>\n<p>As a testament to this method, our website ( <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/\">SEO Design Solutions</a> ) can rank in 10 minutes from publishing a keyword in a title in a blog post for a keyword up to 4,000,000 competing pages in phrase match (which would take a less authoritative site months to rank). Our websites <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/is-seo-about-rankings-or-authority/\">SEO ceiling</a> is higher due to authority and trust. This in turn allows us to devour less competitive keywords with ease, often by simply creating a page (and building a few themed internal links).</p>\n<p>The beautiful thing is, this is a scalable, repeatable SEO tactic. Although, it does require long-term dedication, the results are immense when you implement a strategic content development plan based on topical nodes of relevance within a market.</p>\n<p>The genuine premise is based on <strong>leaving no page behind</strong> or rather understanding the life cycle of <strong>what</strong> and <strong>how a webpage will evolve</strong> and eventually serve as a topical/pivotal hub.  The distinction of this tactic is that it allows a skilled SEO practitioner to set the stage organically and allow their <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/you-reap-what-you-sow-with-organic-seo/\">SEO seeds</a> to unfold over time vs. just focusing on landing pages and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/link-building-seo-link-types-and-tactics/\">links</a> alone.</p>\n<p>For example, if your website architecture and link-flow are properly formatted from the onset, meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capping links between pages (meaning minimizing excessive leaks from a high volume of navigation or contextual links) such as capping links on a page to under 50 links (for navigational links) or capping contextual links to 1 link for every 100 words of body content (i.e. 500 words 5 contextual links).</li>\n<li>Prevention of duplicate content from recurring elements in sidebars or templates (which neutralize relevancy on the page level and prevent a page from passing optimal ranking factor to other mission critical landing pages).</li>\n<li>Page specific landing pages are created in the root folder (using exact match URL’s, succinct titles, reflective H1 and H2 tags and meta data).</li>\n<li>An internal linking strategy (including internal link thresholds) are planned and executed (via dripping internal links in content over time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-          Then you can funnel ranking factor at leisure to dozens, hundreds or thousands of landing pages over time.</p>\n<p>The first prerequisite for grooming a favorable search engine ranking is simple; create a page specifically that corresponds to your keyword. After the <strong>“exact match”</strong> landing page is completed, not you have a destination to provide internal link weight to those <strong>“exact match”</strong> <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/duplicate-content-and-shingle-analysis-for-seo/\">shingles</a> (keywords or group of words).</p>\n<p>The more dynamic the website, the more opportunity for growth, mind you, this means leaving no page behind (through lack of internal links, and / or link flow).</p>\n<p>I suggest you plan on getting 3-5 links min. for internal <strong>“supporting article”</strong> pages. Even though their purpose may not be to get ranked, if they are not indexed or have enough citation (on page or off page) then they are virtually useless unless cultivated.</p>\n<p>So, if you are expecting to <strong>“just add content”</strong> without rhyme, reason or strategy and you inadvertently neglect to (a) get the supporting page sufficient link-flow (from on site or off site means), then those pages cannot pass along any on page reputation, since (b) those pages alone (without support) are not considered authoritative.</p>\n<p>One way to accomplish this simply is through RSS syndication and promotion of deep nested URL’s from your category or supporting article pages (using RSS aggregators to ping other services that create instant backlinks).</p>\n<p>To develop backlinks on auto pilot, you can leverage properties such as technorati, icerocket, jumptags, amplify and other RSS syndication sources provide trusted backlinks that pass the necessary validation for a search engine to assess the page as worthy.</p>\n<p>The key to this technique is to create internal pages budding with links from outside sources, while simultaneously scaling additional content (through <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">website silo architecture</a>). The process works by cultivating pages that can attract their own links (2) those pages eventually gain Page Rank and/or domain trust and (3) they become pages that (a) rank and (b) can pass along vital ranking factor vs. an orphaned page (that previously, you may have inadvertently expected to create value). The stronger all your pages are, the stronger the website becomes.</p>\n<p>The takeaway is:</p>\n<p>1)      Create stellar on page content for the long-haul (create content that can stand the test of time and eventually stem to rank for additional keywords and key phrase variations).</p>\n<p>2)      Get links to internal pages from (a) tactful internal links (b) categorical sitemaps (c) other theme relevant internal pages and (d) deep links from a variety of IP sources.</p>\n<p>3)      Never underestimate the budding of authority (pages you forget about today could be stable landing pages of tomorrow and stem into a steady baseline of improved traffic and conversions.</p>\n<p>So, create with the long-term purpose of building an authoritative website using expert content that is both compelling, engaging and worthy of syndication and allow that syndication /citation to explode through exceeding the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/keyword-relevance-thresholds/\">tipping point / thresholds</a> for their primary “groomed” keywords.</p>\n<p>Coupled with a firm understanding of a hierarchical structure (using themes and keyword clusters) you can scale over time (much like Wikipedia) to devour an entire semantic market, one keyword at a time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=foR-mMwBr_g:uZ0lz8wBHck:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/foR-mMwBr_g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}s:11:\"description\";s:361:\"Theoretically, websites do not get stronger by themselves, they need help.

Although, it does require long-term dedication, the results are immense when you implement a strategic content development plan based on topical nodes of relevance within a market.</p>\n<p>The genuine premise is based on <strong>leaving no page behind</strong> or rather understanding the life cycle of <strong>what</strong> and <strong>how a webpage will evolve</strong> and eventually serve as a topical/pivotal hub.  The distinction of this tactic is that it allows a skilled SEO practitioner to set the stage organically and allow their <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/you-reap-what-you-sow-with-organic-seo/\">SEO seeds</a> to unfold over time vs. just focusing on landing pages and <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/link-building-seo-link-types-and-tactics/\">links</a> alone.</p>\n<p>For example, if your website architecture and link-flow are properly formatted from the onset, meaning:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Capping links between pages (meaning minimizing excessive leaks from a high volume of navigation or contextual links) such as capping links on a page to under 50 links (for navigational links) or capping contextual links to 1 link for every 100 words of body content (i.e. 500 words 5 contextual links).</li>\n<li>Prevention of duplicate content from recurring elements in sidebars or templates (which neutralize relevancy on the page level and prevent a page from passing optimal ranking factor to other mission critical landing pages).</li>\n<li>Page specific landing pages are created in the root folder (using exact match URL’s, succinct titles, reflective H1 and H2 tags and meta data).</li>\n<li>An internal linking strategy (including internal link thresholds) are planned and executed (via dripping internal links in content over time).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-          Then you can funnel ranking factor at leisure to dozens, hundreds or thousands of landing pages over time.</p>\n<p>The first prerequisite for grooming a favorable search engine ranking is simple; create a page specifically that corresponds to your keyword. After the <strong>“exact match”</strong> landing page is completed, not you have a destination to provide internal link weight to those <strong>“exact match”</strong> <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/duplicate-content-and-shingle-analysis-for-seo/\">shingles</a> (keywords or group of words).</p>\n<p>The more dynamic the website, the more opportunity for growth, mind you, this means leaving no page behind (through lack of internal links, and / or link flow).</p>\n<p>I suggest you plan on getting 3-5 links min. for internal <strong>“supporting article”</strong> pages. Even though their purpose may not be to get ranked, if they are not indexed or have enough citation (on page or off page) then they are virtually useless unless cultivated.</p>\n<p>So, if you are expecting to <strong>“just add content”</strong> without rhyme, reason or strategy and you inadvertently neglect to (a) get the supporting page sufficient link-flow (from on site or off site means), then those pages cannot pass along any on page reputation, since (b) those pages alone (without support) are not considered authoritative.</p>\n<p>One way to accomplish this simply is through RSS syndication and promotion of deep nested URL’s from your category or supporting article pages (using RSS aggregators to ping other services that create instant backlinks).</p>\n<p>To develop backlinks on auto pilot, you can leverage properties such as technorati, icerocket, jumptags, amplify and other RSS syndication sources provide trusted backlinks that pass the necessary validation for a search engine to assess the page as worthy.</p>\n<p>The key to this technique is to create internal pages budding with links from outside sources, while simultaneously scaling additional content (through <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-videos/seo-video-how-to-properly-silo-your-website/\">website silo architecture</a>). The process works by cultivating pages that can attract their own links (2) those pages eventually gain Page Rank and/or domain trust and (3) they become pages that (a) rank and (b) can pass along vital ranking factor vs. an orphaned page (that previously, you may have inadvertently expected to create value). The stronger all your pages are, the stronger the website becomes.</p>\n<p>The takeaway is:</p>\n<p>1)      Create stellar on page content for the long-haul (create content that can stand the test of time and eventually stem to rank for additional keywords and key phrase variations).</p>\n<p>2)      Get links to internal pages from (a) tactful internal links (b) categorical sitemaps (c) other theme relevant internal pages and (d) deep links from a variety of IP sources.</p>\n<p>3)      Never underestimate the budding of authority (pages you forget about today could be stable landing pages of tomorrow and stem into a steady baseline of improved traffic and conversions.</p>\n<p>So, create with the long-term purpose of building an authoritative website using expert content that is both compelling, engaging and worthy of syndication and allow that syndication /citation to explode through exceeding the <a href=\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-consulting/keyword-relevance-thresholds/\">tipping point / thresholds</a> for their primary “groomed” keywords.</p>\n<p>Coupled with a firm understanding of a hierarchical structure (using themes and keyword clusters) you can scale over time (much like Wikipedia) to devour an entire semantic market, one keyword at a time.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/109189625824502979466/?rel=author\" rel=\"author\"> -Jeffrey</a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=foR-mMwBr_g:uZ0lz8wBHck:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" border=\"0\"></img></a>\n</div><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/foR-mMwBr_g\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>\";}}s:7:\"channel\";a:9:{s:5:\"title\";s:28:\"SEO Design Solutions™ Blog\";s:4:\"link\";s:38:\"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog\";s:11:\"description\";s:94:\"Search Engine Optimization Strategies, Tips, Tactics and Techniques from SEO Design Solutions.\";s:8:\"language\";s:5:\"en-US\";s:13:\"lastbuilddate\";s:29:\"Thu, 11 Jul 2013 12:55:27 PDT\";s:9:\"generator\";s:29:\"http://wordpress.org/?v=3.5.2\";s:2:\"sy\";a:2:{s:12:\"updateperiod\";s:6:\"hourly\";s:15:\"updatefrequency\";s:1:\"1\";}s:10:\"feedburner\";a:3:{s:14:\"emailserviceid\";s:22:\"SeoDesignSolutionsBlog\";s:18:\"feedburnerhostname\";s:28:\"http://feedburner.google.com\";s:9:\"feedflare\";s:391:\"Subscribe with My Yahoo!Subscribe with NewsGatorSubscribe with My AOLSubscribe with BloglinesSubscribe with NetvibesSubscribe with GoogleSubscribe with PageflakesSubscribe with PlusmoSubscribe with The Free DictionarySubscribe with Bitty BrowserSubscribe with Live.comSubscribe with Excite MIXSubscribe with WebwagSubscribe with Podcast ReadySubscribe with WikioSubscribe with Daily Rotation\";}s:7:\"tagline\";s:94:\"Search Engine Optimization Strategies, Tips, Tactics and Techniques from SEO Design Solutions.\";}s:9:\"textinput\";a:0:{}s:5:\"image\";a:0:{}s:9:\"feed_type\";s:3:\"RSS\";s:12:\"feed_version\";s:3:\"2.0\";s:5:\"stack\";a:0:{}s:9:\"inchannel\";b:0;s:6:\"initem\";b:0;s:9:\"incontent\";b:0;s:11:\"intextinput\";b:0;s:7:\"inimage\";b:0;s:13:\"current_field\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"current_namespace\";b:0;s:19:\"_CONTENT_CONSTRUCTS\";a:6:{i:0;s:7:\"content\";i:1;s:7:\"summary\";i:2;s:4:\"info\";i:3;s:5:\"title\";i:4;s:7:\"tagline\";i:5;s:9:\"copyright\";}s:4:\"etag\";s:27:\"3/xVKcYQrnbIlqfasEiP1yvRsvM\";s:13:\"last_modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:30:32 GMT\";}','no'),(292,'category_children','a:2:{i:1;a:3:{i:0;i:6;i:1;i:7;i:2;i:8;}i:3;a:2:{i:0;i:9;i:1;i:10;}}','yes'),(295,'_site_transient_timeout_theme_roots','1374830010','yes'),(296,'_site_transient_theme_roots','a:7:{s:9:\"BooThemes\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:12:\"IzMobileBlue\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:12:\"jquerymobile\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:2:\"js\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:11:\"mobiletheme\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:12:\"twentyeleven\";s:7:\"/themes\";s:12:\"twentytwelve\";s:7:\"/themes\";}','yes');
